# Ugh Nugh and the bleeping invasion

*Gather your stoner friends, pick up those spears and travel through
the subterranean dinosaur refuge to find the source of the flying
drones that keep pestering your tribe. Infiltrate the lair of the
rocket men and wrest the eye of eyes from their cold gauntlets and
return your land to peace and quiet.*

The drones have been spying on your every move, watching your most
intimate moments, with incessant humming and beeping and blinking.
You've smashed a few but enough is enough. They come from accross the
river and that needs to stop.

## Wilderness

<img src="hex-map.svg" class="map break" alt="In the north-west is your
village. In the south-west across the river is the fortress. In the
north-east is a volcano. In the south-east is a swamp with a dragon
lair.">

**01.01** Your village is safe. There are about 20 **people** here
that you could arm with spears<span class="stats"> (HD 1 AC 9 1d6
<i>spear</i> MV 12 SV 19)</span>.

**01.02** The jungle is dense. 3 **velociraptor** hunting<span
class="stats"> (HD 2 AC 7 1d6/1d4/1d4 <i>bite + claws</i> MV 18
SV 18)</span>. A fight attracts one of the **drones**, betraying your
intentions<span class="stats"> (HD ½ AC 0 1d6 <i>shock</i> MV 15
SV 16)</span>.

**01.03** Up in these hills stands the *fortress of the rocket men*
(see below). Do you approach openly or discreetly?

**02.01** Your favourite hunting grounds. An open *pit trap* of yours
with a **giant armadillo**<span class="stats"> (HD 5 AC 5 1d6/1d4/1d4
<i>bite + claws</i> MV 6 SV 15)</span>.

**02.02** The jungle turns into swamp. 3 **hadrosaurs** grazing<span

hold</i> MV 12 SV 17; they never let go of living prey and just keep
dealing damage)</span>.

**03.03** On a compost heap 10m high is the lair of an intelligent,
fire-breathing **dragonodon**<span class="stats"> (HD 10 AC 3

## Fortress of the rocket men

at anything that moves<span class="stats"> (save vs. wands to avoid
1d6 damage)</span>.

**4** Empty control seat. If approached discreetly *and discovered*,

guardian angel of room 5.

gun</i> MV 12 SV 16)</span>.

**7** *Abel*'s bedroom.

**10** *Drogon*'s bedroom. If the alarm did not sound, he's here,
reading, out of his suit<span class="stats"> (HD 3 AC 9 1d6 <i>zap
gun</i> MV 12 SV 17)</span>.

**11** *Eelam*'s bedroom. Half-eaten leftovers on the bed. It a

shift outside, drinking some water<span class="stats"> (HD 3 AC 9 1d6
<i>zap gun</i> MV 12 SV 17)</span>. If **Abel** wasn't on the ground
floor, he's also sitting here, looking at pictures of your clan.

**15** Control room with six monitor and the *eye of eyes* that
controls the drones. **Elam** is here, not in his suit, looking for
approaching outsiders<span class="stats"> (HD 3 AC 9 1d6 <i>zap

door leads to a platform outside. A suit is required to open the door.

<div class="stats">
<h2>Treasure</h2>

<p>The thermal isolation layer of each <em>suit</em> allows
you to extract gold filaments worth 500 gold, each. They can also be
sold for 750 gold. Each suit can fly for 6 turns, except for the one
*Flateem* is wearing. That suit already spent 3 turns for the day.

<p>Each <em>zap gun</em> can be sold for 500 gold. They are
all charged and able to fire 20 shots.

<p>Without a way to control the <em>guardian angels</em>, each
can be sold as a fantastic statue for 1000 gold.

<p>The <em>device charger</em> at the base of the tower can
recharge one device over night. Destroying it poisons the land for ten
miles in every direction. Most people will not appreciate what it is
for and therefore it cannot be sold for money.

<p>Max. gold value: 13 500. Taking over the tower of the rocket men and
learning all their secrets: <em>priceless</em>.
