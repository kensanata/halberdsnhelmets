\chapter{Principles}

This book is for the \key{referee} of the game. It is based on the
following principles:
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{No Skills}: Be diplomatic or intimidating at the table
  and entertain the other players. Guess where hidden treasure and
  secret doors are based on the clues given.

\item \textbf{Fewer Classes}: There is little mechanical
  differentiation between characters. What matters is personality,
  goals, experiences.\marginnote{We can always add more classes later
    in the game, no problem.}

\item \textbf{Quick Character Generation}: Easy character generation
  with few actual choices speeds things up. A high attrition rate is
  more acceptable if you can bring multiple characters to the table
  and make extras in a minute or two.

\item \textbf{Smaller Bonuses}: The smaller bonuses simplify the math
  and produce far less trickle down effects. This also makes the
  initial ability rolls less important.

\item \textbf{Random Character Generation}: Random character
  generation may surprise players and provide interesting party
  dynamics.\marginnote{Playing with the cards fate has dealt you is
    part of the entertainment.}

\item \textbf{Rare Healing}: Players need to avoid wandering monsters
  and avoid unnecessary fights. This makes strategic decisions (when
  to fight) more important than tactical decisions (how to fight).

\item \textbf{Simple Combat}: No explicit rules for combat maneuvers
  and battle grids result in quicker combat rounds, less waiting for
  your turn, and more time to do other stuff---or more fights per
  session, if desired.

\item \textbf{Little Damage, Few Hit Points}: Fewer attacks and
  smaller damage bonuses simplify the math and speed things up.

\item \textbf{Treasure is Experience}: This encourages players to
  research their goals and picking their fights carefully. It also
  provides for an easy and quick reason for the party to form and go
  adventuring.

\item \textbf{No Buying or Selling of Magic Item}: Getting them
  should always involve adventuring.

\item \textbf{Random Encounters, Random Monsters}: This forces the
  referee to improvise and adapt the story on the fly.

\end{enumerate}



\chapter{Running the Game}

\textbf{Keep it short}: My main problem is that I don't want to spend
a lot of time in preparation for a session. Half an hour for a three
hour slot is all I'm prepared to invest.

\textbf{Campaign Map}: When I
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2011-01-13_Campaign_Start}{start a
  new campaign}, I create
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2009-12-02_Hexcrawl}{a small hex
  map}. You could use my
\href{https://campaignwiki.org/text-mapper}{random hexmap generator},
for example. I only start worrying about the ruins and lairs in the
various hexes once players actually explore the region. This is going
to be an
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2007-02-14_DM_Advice_–_Organic_Campaigns}{organic
  campaign}. I like to start with a wilderness surrounding a small
village. In the wilderness, travelling a hex takes a day. That keeps
things simple. See below for more on traveling. I work on the map,
adding more locations as players push forward.

\textbf{Use every idea} as soon as possible. Do not save good ideas
for later! Use them now. You will have more good ideas in the future.

\key{Settlements}: Every settlement has two or three interesting,
named people. These are the people of authority the characters are
likely to talk to. Every settlement should have a building or two
where you can find said named people, and an inn, or an exaplanation
for the missing inn. Don't bother with a map for the settlement.

\key{People}: Most of civilization consists of neutral, egoistical,
normal humans and appropriate demihumans from the monster manual.
Don't bother assigning levels unless these people are important.

\medskip
\index{Level!Others}
\begin{tabular}{cp{9cm}}
Level & Role \\
 0 & ordinary people \\
 1 & veterans, trained guards \\
 3 & a boss of one or two dozen people, captain of the watch, bandit boss \\
 5 & lord over a small settlement, a contested five mile hex, a tower, a small fortress, a sheriff, two of these might be the assistants of a level 9 lord \\
 7 & a captain of a small army, the most powerful chieftain of a tribe, a second in command to a level 9 lord \\
 9 & lord over a town, a castle plus a town or two, multiple villages, a region up to thirty miles in diameter, known up to a hundred miles away \\
 11 & great heroes, the favorites of the gods \\
 13 & avatars of the gods \\
 15 & demigods and immortals \\
 17 & god-like, granting wishes! \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\key{Names}: Keep lists of names to assign to non-player
characters. I like names to depend on gender and culture, so I usually
have multiple lists.

\key{News}: Spies and sages allow you to feed setting information
to your players. Get into the habit of preparing a little something to
report for spies and sages in the employ of player characters.
Actionable information is preferred. Activities of rivals that can be
stopped. Rumors of treasures that can be sought. Let players know
where to go next if they want to pursue a certain goal.

\key{Dungeons}: I like to prepare a number of small
dungeons\marginnote{If you need some inspiration, check out the
  \href{http://www.dungeoncontest.com/}{One Page Dungeon Contest}
  submissions. When the party explores one dungeon, use the time to
  make up some events surrounding the other dungeons. Giant frog
  plague? Cultists spreading? Rival party found some treasure?} and
place them on the campaign map. I make note of a few rumors that would
lead the party to the various dungeons and warnings they might hear in
order to prepare them for it. This is a sandbox campaign and the
encounters do not depend on the power level of the party. Instead, the
party gets to choose the risk they are willing to face by choosing
areas that are more or less dangerous based on the rumors they hear.

\key{Treasure}: I just roll for random treasure. Treasure spent
earns experience: \SI{1}{gp} is worth 1 XP.\marginnote[-2em]{Expand on the
  list of \emph{buildings} and add cathedrals, tempels, hippodromes
  and the like as your players will need things to spend their gold
  on.}

\key{Magic Items}: I like magic weapons. If I roll up a simple +1
weapon I often pimp it with some extra gimmick.\marginnote{Talking,
  gnawing, cursing, trailing smoke, oozing strange liquids, …} Magic
items are not for sale. Potions can be bought from alchemists. Every
alchemist has a handful of potions they know how to make. They cost
around \SI{500}{gp}.

\index{Stocking}\textbf{Stocking the dungeon}: Use a d20 and roll on
the following table.\marginnote{This is easier than rolling two d6
  which is what
  \href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2013-08-21_One_Roll_Dungeon_Stocking}{Moldvay
    uses}.}

\medskip
\index{Stocking}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
 d20 & Contents and Treasure \\
 1–5 & Empty \\
 6 & Unguarded treasure \\
 7 & Trap and unguarded treasure \\
 8–9 & Trap \\
 10–12 & Monster \\
 13–15 & Monster and treasure \\
 16–20 & Special \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\newpage

\index{Encounters}\textbf{Random Wilderness Encounters}: Based
on the current area\marginnote{Keep using the same table while the
  player characters are in the same region: the same valley, the same
  forest, the same mountain range---basically a bunch of hexes that
  seem to belong together. } the party is in, jot down a little random
encounter table. Consider the critters in the surrounding dungeons,
think of a theme, browse the monster manuals and look at the pictures.
If you like beholders, maybe add a dwarf merchant with an extra eye
stalk or two to the encounter table. He's a spy for the beholder! If
you like frogs, go for an amphibian theme and pick psionic frog men,
giant frogs, toads, froglings, and so on. If you have a theme,
consider antagonists. Is the frog faction competing with the gnomes?
Add a gnome entry!

Add one or more entries for \textbf{peaceful folk} from the
neighborhood or named people from nearby settlements. Two of these is
a good number. Add these at the top of the list. During the night, add
this number as you roll.\marginnote{This is how you get slightly
  different results for day time and night time encounters. In this
  example, merchants and soldiers are only encountered during the day.
  At night, add +2 to your roll. Thus, psionic frog men and frog
  demons are only encountered during the night.}

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{rl}
d6 & Encounter \\
\sun~1 & merchants (1d6) \\
\sun~2 & soldiers  (1d6+3) \\
  3 & gnomes (1d6+2) \\
  4 & giant frogs (1d4) \\
  5 & froglings (2d6) \\
  6 & giant dragonfly \\
\rightmoon~7 & psionic frog men (2d6) \\
\rightmoon~8 & frog demons (1d4) \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\key{Exploration}: Typically travel is initiated by a non-player
characters telling the player characters about a location. Usually
directions are accurate and the location and any landmarks on the way
get placed on the player map. When traveling, player characters cannot
get lost. A hex is usually big enough for multiple locations (a hill,
a lake, a castle, a village, a dungeon). Unknown locations are not be
easy to find. Use the typical \emph{search} abilities: 1/6 per day for
humans, 2/6 per day for demihumans. Known locations can always be
found.

\key{Travel}: The default is one hex traveled per day\marginnote{The
  actual \emph{procedure} at the gaming table is simple: players tell
  me where they want to go. There is a 1 in 6 chance for a daylight
  encounter and a 1 in 6 chance for a nighttime encounter for every
  hex traveled. That's it.} unless there are trails or roads (two per
day; no bonus for riding or flying) or they are traveling by ship
along a coast (in which case it'll be eight hexes per day). As it
stands, this ignores movement speeds and hex size. You travel one hex
per day, that's it. I usually think that one hex is five miles, but
players don't need to know that.\marginnote{If you use five mile
  hexes, that's an area of about \SI{22}{mi²}.}

\key{Lairs}: Many hexes have a building of some sort. I place stuff I
got from the net or from books I bought. I add lairs for all the
intelligent monsters on my encounter tables. As time passes, I might
add more locations and lairs to known hexes. It's simply not possible
to \emph{completely} map a hex. There's always more stuff to discover.
Don't be afraid to add new stuff to existing hexes.

If you have some monsters on your random encounter
table\marginnote{These improvised lairs will necessarily be simple
  one, two or three room affairs. No problem.} and haven't decided
where the lairs of these creatures are, there's a 1 in 6 chance when
encountering them that you have found their lair.

\newpage

\textbf{Monsters}: It's easier if monsters announce themselves: let
players find, smell or hear something.\marginnote{Use the
  \emph{reaction roll}. Not all encounters need to end in a fight. Use
  \emph{morale checks} ins combat. Not all fights are to the death.
  Here are some typical morale scores:

  \medskip
  \index{Morale!of others}
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    2 & animals that will always run \\
    3 & animals when cornered \\
    4 & herbivores \\
    5 & carnivores and cowards \\
    6 & cautious people \\
    7 & normal men \\
    8 & well led humanoids \\
    9 & disciplined troops \\
    10 & fanatics \\
    11 & lunatics \\
    12 & unnatural creatures \\
  \end{tabular}} This allows them to choose
their approach. Determine encounters before the game starts or have a
procedure to determine the number of monsters encountered ready. Use
1d8 if you're at a loss. This makes sure that you're not scaling the
encounter to the players. Let the \emph{players decide} whether to
engage or not.

\textbf{Animals}: Remember that most animals don't want to fight.
That's why the list of monsters only include dangerous animals. That
doesn't mean deer and birds are not encountered. It just means that
those encounters usually aren't interesting enough to warrant a lot of
time at the table.

\textbf{Adapt the encounter} as it happens. If your players are bored,
let the monsters fight. If your players need guidance, have the
monsters talk. If your players are afraid, make it easy to avoid the
encounter. The entertainment of your friends at the table takes
priority. A \emph{total party kill} can be part of it. Know your
players.

\textbf{Keep Adding}: In order add life to the world, you need to have two or
three events or changes happen between sessions if time passes
in-game. A lot of it should relate to what the party did. If their dog
was killed by a giant crab and they didn't rescue it, then there will
be a rumor of a ghost dog haunting the beaches. If they discovered
skeletons in a crypt and fled, they have released undead that will be
roaming the neighborhood. If they had hirelings with them, those will
be spreading rumors of a necromancer. Use these rumors to add big and
small adventure options for the players to focus on.

\textbf{Focus Follows Players}: As time passes, you should see a
constant trickle of little ideas to add to your campaign. Prepare for
3-7 of these potential adventures and keep a list of open plots to
remind players of ongoing issues. More adventures develop wherever the
party shows up. If the party fights a mammoth and decides to track it
back to the forest, then maybe there will be neanderthals living
there. If the players try to contact them, maybe there will be a
sabre-toothed cat and a velociraptor in the area. If they investigate
the velociraptor, they might find a valley full of dinosaurs.

Essentially players express their interest in the campaign by spending
time. If players never leave town, then they want urban adventures. If
they keep returning to your megadungeon, then that's what they want.
Giving players real options will make sure the game adapts to their
preferences (and yours, given that you are providing the options).

\key{Contacts}: Keep a list of contacts. These provide easy plot
hooks. Magic-users provide new spells in exchange for quests. Sages
provide information about items found in exchange for quests. Rulers
provide men-at-arms in exchange for quests. They can provide rumors
and gossip that hint at things to get involved in. Provide enough to
allow choice but not too much in order to save preparation time and
avoid decision paralysis. Keep it somewhere between three and seven. I
also like to play up alignment. A drug abusing alchemist hands out
chaotic quests, a curious insect trainer hands out lawful quests.

\textbf{Living World}: Keep a list of a handful in addition to your
list of contacts. Between sessions, check whether any of the entries
need to be removed or changed. Consider adding new entries. It's best
to do this soon after the session when recent events are still fresh.
Let your players know about these changes during the next session.
"You notice a new bard in the Yellow Straightjacket. She is called
Miela, newly arrived from Halgorn. Ilaria appears to have left for
Tlan."

\key{Maps}: Maps are inspiring. They provide a sense of place, every
landmark they contain is a potential exploration goal, yet another
option for players to pursue. Keep a campaign map, hand out treasure
maps, let other characters draw maps for the party.

Players need options, and maps are like option tokens. Maps are also
props that are very easy to make.

\textbf{Goals}: Talk to your players about their character goals every
now and then. Identify the players that have interesting goals you'd
like to pursue, and start providing rumors that lead to adventures on
the way to achieving those goals.

Two or three players pushing their own agendas can be a lot of fun.
There will be a little rivalry because each character needs to pursue
their own quests. There will be some cooperation: "I'll help you
retrieve ice from that glacier for your frost rapier if you will help
me find Xu-Li the fire sage."

Not everybody needs to have goals! You just need enough player goals
to add adventure seeds to your campaign. If all the players have
divergent goals, they end up not having a reason to adventure
together. In that case you might be better off adding a traditional
villain to the mix: A powerful nemesis that sends minions after the
characters, builds an army to attack their home base, coordinates the
bad guys in the region such that the party absolutely needs to fight.
Just increase the pressure whenever the players are starting to
squabble again.

\key{Spotlight}: I like to give enemies the opportunity to shine every
now and then. Don't overdo it. I find that providing a single
non-player character the opportunity to shine in a session is about
right.

The same is true for player characters. I'll try to emphasize
situations where a player character specifically did something
awesome. It lets players know that I appreciated their character being
there and the things they did. Everybody likes this.

If a player is very entertaining in the game, I like to encourage
them. Non-player characters will go along with a lot of silliness as
long as it doesn't strain my credulity.

Even quiet players like to shine. Sometimes you just have to guess
what makes them tick. Perhaps they'd like romantic success? As the
extroverts grab the spotlight, make sure to interrupt the action once
or twice per session and offer a scene to an introverted player. The
leader is charmed by their presence, the enemy wants to talk to nobody
else but them, the farmers ask them for advice. Don't overdo it.
Sometimes shy players don't want to make big decisions. A public
display of respect or admiration might be enough.

\key{Planning}: If players invest a lot of time into a particular
plan, I like to join in and provide advice---my commentary stands in
for their character's knowledge of the world.\marginnote{If you feel
  that they over-planned it, make sure you use words like "boring
  wait" and "endless hours pouring over your preparations" as you
  remind them of the time wasted in-game.} I also like to reward
players for the effort by having their plans succeed. Be sure to
recapitulate the successful execution of the plan, coloring it
appropriately. Avoid the evil feedback loop of foiling their
plans.\marginnote{Avoid boring "it doesn't work" results. Succeed or
  fail spectacularly.} They'll counter it by spending even more time
planning or by trying to keep you out of the planning phase. This
makes the session boring.

If players don't want to plan a lot, then that's even more awesome,
because it gives you the opportunity to improvise some action scene.
Roll for wandering monsters or the like and go for it.

\key{Background}: I tend to prefer character accomplishments to
character abilities. Thus, player characters in my games are
mechanically simple. If a player wants to do something that I think is
out of the ordinary, I ask for an explanation: "Do you think your
character can do this?" If the player says yes, then we think of an
explanation and have the player write it down on the character sheet.
That's how we learn that the dwarf has in fact served as a scout and
an ensign in the dwarven army.

\key{Development}: Hopefully the events at the table shape the
characters. Was the character generous or avaricious? Was the
character diplomatic or rude? Was the character honest or deceitful?
That's what we need all the social encounters for. By interacting with
other characters, players can develop their own character. Therefore,
they need to meet people that can be cheated or dealt with honestly.
They need to meet people that can be robbed and people that beg. It
forces players to make choices regarding their characters. It's how
they grow to be more real.

Avoid situations where there is only one course of action. If you can
only rescue the baron's child, then there's no choice involved. You
should add temptation at every single step. Slavers will be interested
in the child. Enemies of the baron will be interested.

Sometimes there are no obvious choices, and none of the choices will
help define the character. The baron's child might not want to return
back home, preferring to go on adventure instead. The character's
choice will define what they see as filial duty and family integrity.
Hardly heroic decisions to be made! Use these situations rarely.

\textbf{Influence and Reputation}: Find a way to let characters gain
influence and a reputation through adventuring. This anchors them in
the campaign world and encourages character development instead of
character ability gain. It's a different sort of
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2009-11-24 Rewards}{reward}.

\textbf{Announce consequences} before players commit to
actions.\marginnote{The following list is from
  \href{https://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2011/09/on-ressurecting-quantum-ogre-and-having.html}{the
    Hack \& Slash blog}.} There can only be meaningful choice if
players know what to expect. ("If you fail the roll, you'll […]. Do
you want to risk it?")

\textbf{Provide information} if players are unsure. You can wrap it in
vague language, but be sure to provide the necessary information.
("It's hard to say, but you feel a nagging suspicion that he's
probably hiding something.")

\textbf{Provide warnings} if players are putting themselves in danger.
You're aiming for "I knew it!" when something bad befalls player
characters. ("You notice that the hanging bridge above the tar pits
seems frail. Just make sure nobody cuts those ropes!")

\textbf{Provide alternatives} if you think that what players want
should be impossible. ("You can't just buy a magic weapon but they say
there's a hidden entrance to a goblin market in the Smoke Forest.")

\textbf{Add obstacles} whenever players are getting what they want.
("The insect trainer will teach your lizard how to spy ahead if you
provide her with a living giant wasp.")



\chapter{Gods \& Demons}

The gods and demons are important because characters will able to
visit their \emph{halls}. These can be reached by secret \emph{gates}
when sailing the \key{Astral Sea} when climbing the branches of the
\emph{World Tree}\marginnote{The World Tree is
  \hiref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil}{Yggradsil}. In
  certain locations, the planar boundaries are weakened and it is
  possible to enter a sacred grove or push through a thorny hedge and
  find yourself on one of the branches of the World Tree. The ground
  is made of living wood. Most often it is steep. There are leaves and
  branches everywhere, secondary growth, birds, insects, anything that
  flies. If you are pushed off the branch and you can't fly, you're
  dead. If the gate is popular, people will have added ropes, ladders,
  stairs, bridges. Soon enough it is a confusing, living labyrinth of
  passages. Unless you know where the gates are it will take you a
  week to find a random gate.

  To learn more, start with the Wikipedia article on
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_cosmology}{Norse
    cosmology}.} connecting all the planes of existence.

There is a chance that the gods will send one of their agents to help
if their name is called. In order to succeed, players need to keep
track of \textbf{a score for each god} they care about. As characters
do things to honor or spite the various gods, their score goes up.
This could be about saving or killing their followers, building altars
and temple in their name, defiling their altars or acting on visions
sent by them. This score is the percent chance that the god will act
when their name is called. Whether the agents appearing will in fact
help the characters depends on their past actions. An evil demon lord
like Set might still send a naga to help a paladin of Mitra, hoping to
mess with them. The score only goes down if you ignore the gods.

When paladins and clerics cast \textbf{spells of level four and
  higher}, the spell effect usually involves the appearance of such an
agent and an opportunity for some discourse arises.

\section{Freya and Odin}
\label{sec:odin}
\label{sec:freya}
\index{Freya}
\index{Odin}

Freya is the goddess of winter, of spring, of fertility, of grain, of
war, of cats and \hyperref[animal:Boar]{boars}, of magic. She leads
the valkyries and collects half the slain in battle. These dine with
her in \key{Sessrúmnir}, her hall in
Asgard.\marginnote{\hiref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgard}{Asgard}
  is a plane consisting of nothing but the divine city where many of
  the gods have their halls, surrounded by a gargantuan wall. Outside
  is the \emph{Astral Sea}. It can be reached by sailing that very sea
  or by climbing the World Tree, \emph{Yggdrasil}.}

Odin is the god of wisdom, of magic and poetry, of war, of eagles and
ravens, of runes, of wanderers. He wields a magic spear, he raises the
dead, he rides an eight legged horse called Draupnir. The other half
of the slain in battle dine with him in \key{Valhalla}, his hall in
Asgard.

In times of need, both of them will send a \textbf{valkyrie} named
\textit{War}, \textit{Mercy} \textit{Spear}, \textit{Cruel} or
\textit{Fight}.

\begin{quote}
  HD~6 AC~2 1d8 \textit{sword+3} MV~18 ML~12 XP~820; flying; only

\end{quote}

The swords of valkyries are bright swords of light. When swinging such
a sword, the wielder is compelled\marginnote{When resisting such a
  compel for the third time, the sword looses its magic. The owner is
  considered unfit to wield it.} to shout for blood and glory at the
top of their voice. Also, when allies are fighting, the owner of such
a sword is compelled to draw it and join this melee.

Loki is the god of lies, of deceit, of misdeeds, of excuses and
explanations, of looking the other way, of tricksters, thieves and
shape changers, a friend of giants, the innocently accused, the
misunderstood and the innocent. He can be found brooding in his hall
\key{Utgard} in
Jotunheim.\marginnote{\hiref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\%C3\%B6tunheimr}{Jotunheim}\label{key:jotunheim}
  is a plane of frost and giants. It can be reached by sailing the
  river \key{Ifing} from Asgard.}

In times of need, he might send a nameless \textbf{shape changer}
named \emph{Quiet}, \emph{Face}, \emph{Melt} or \emph{Mom}. Clearly,
this is mostly useful when in need of deception.

Mitra is the goddess of law, of fire, of bulls, of contracts, of
bonds, the swearing of oaths, of honesty and truth, of loyalty and
sacrifice for the community. Her hall is built atop a lake of fire
deep underground in Muspelheim and called
\emph{Eldivatn}.\marginnote{\hiref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muspelheim}{Muspelheim}\label{key:muspelheim}

\index{Hit Dice|see {HD}}\key{HD} are hit dice; roll as many d8 to
determine hit points, \index{Hit Points|see {hp}}\key{hp}. A +1 or +2
means that the monster attacks as if it had a HD more, so it is
relatively ferocious.

\index{Armor|see {AC}}\key{AC} is armor class and determines how hard
it is to hit.

What follows are all the \emph{attacks} that require a to-hit roll.
Special abilities and spells are listed at the end.

\key{Saving Throw} is next, the letter indicating the class to use (F
stands for fighter and it's the default). The level is usually the
same as the number of hit dice. Animals usually save at half their hit
dice.

\index{Movement|see {MV}}\key{MV} is the movement rate. Often a note
is added to explain unusual values, eg. MV 15 (fly).

\index{Morale|see {ML}}\key{ML} is the morale score.

\key{Animals} fear fire and aren't intelligent, even if giant sized or
trained for war. A trained war dog, for example, will attack when
commanded and it will defend itself when attacked, but it will not
defend others or use interesting tactics.

\key{Mounts} are creatures that can carry somebody on their back. A
mount takes a \emph{retainer} slot. Unlike ordinary retainers, mounts
will not gain levels and they are usually not intelligent. They prefer
not to fight and will only attack somebody that is attacking them in
melee. If their owner dies in combat, mounts are \emph{free} and will
try to flee. If anybody manages to take their rider's place, either by
killing them or otherwise dismounting them, they can \emph{take over}.
Anybody can jump onto a horse and ride it! If a mount is also a
\emph{pet}, then their loyalty is not as easy to command.

\key{Pets} also takes a \emph{retainer slot}. Unlike ordinary
retainers, pets will not gain levels and they are usually not
intelligent. A pet is a \emph{friend}. Thus, they will attack anybody
attacking you in melee, but they won't take a blow for you, nor will
they get involved if you're not being attacked. If their owner dies in
combat, pets will go \emph{feral}. They defend their owner's corpse
against both friends and enemies until the fight is over. Then they
leave, if they can. Taking over a pet requires you to befriend them.

\key{Gems} are all sorts of previous stones. Their value is
determined using the table on the right.\marginnote[-1em]{
  \begin{tabular}{cr}
    1d20   & Value \\
    1--3   &  10 \\
    4--6   &  20 \\

  \end{tabular}} The average value of a gem is \SI{176}{gp}.

\key{Jewelry} is rings, necklaces, bracelets, diadems, crowns,
scepters and the like. Each piece is worth 3d6×\SI{100}{gp}. The average
value for each piece of jewelry is \SI{1050}{gp}.

The basilisk is the "little king of serpents" -- it's a monstrous
snake ten paces long and nearly chest high at its thickest. The
basilisk's scales are usually green or brown, and upon it's head it
wears a crown of gold. It's lair is filled with toxic fumes, a deadly
poison to all. It's breath poisons the air for \SI{30}{ft} around it.
\textbf{When you breathe in these fumes}, save vs.~poison or die. You
can hold your breath for one round and fight. If you keep fighting,
save vs.~death or faint. Once you faint, your body will start
breathing again. At which point you'll need to save vs.~poison or die.
It's gaze will also kill, such is the power of it's poisonous spirit.
\textbf{If it sees you}, and you did not have to save vs.~poison this
round, do so now or die. And finally, if you manage to approach the
basilisk without being slain by it's stench or gaze, you still have to

Don't be fooled by their name. These bees are omnivorous and kill
sheep and halflings for food. \textbf{When stung}, save vs.~poison or
die. These stings are solid. The bee will not die after having stung
its victim.

Centaurs are half man, half horse, born of sun and raincloud, all of

prophecy, nothing seems to be impossible). Unfortunately they also
love to drink and carouse, and they are prone to start fights when
drunk.\marginnote{Depending on how far you want to take it, their

  you know your players before going there.} In combat, they can

settlements, sometimes making their lair in the ruins of once rich and
powerful towns and cities.

All dragons are intelligent and speak the languages of many ancient
empires and the languages of any people currently living in the area.
They have seen it all. Their heart is bent on destruction. Collecting
the treasures of the cities they sacked is their way of preventing a
reconstruction.

\marginnote{Most spell casters of the polymorph traditions prefer to
  \emph{shape shift} into dragons when in danger. As this spell belongs to

  dragon form when they first master the spell and the red dragon form
  when they reach the apex of their power.} Dragons can use

without a \emph{howdah} or castle on its back. With a castle

The current gods and demon lords did not inherit the world. They took
it from their predecessors, the giants, titans and jötunar of old. The
giants are much diminished, now. Much of their magic has been spent in
these struggles long ago, fighting the lords of fire, air and water,
the \hyperref[sec:ifrit]{afarit}, \hyperref[sec:jinni]{jinn} and
\hyperref[sec:marid]{marid}.

The \textbf{hill giants} have lost all their powers of creation. Their
size is all they have left: they are about twice as tall as a human.
They live in remote areas, unconcerned with the world of other people,
trying to stay out of their wars, raising sheep and keeping to
themselves.

Sometimes hill giants are exposed to Earth Blood when as they stumble
around in caves. Survivors occasionally turn into
\hyperref[sec:ettin]{ettins}.

All the other giants are larger: they are about thrice as tall as a
human, maybe more---but certainly no longer as big as a mountain, a
volcano or a glacier. The larger giants can \textbf{throw stones}
doing 3d6 damage for over \SI{200}{ft}.

Both stone and frost giants cast spells and can teach them to you, for

Gnolls are hyena-people living in a matriarchal society. They have

Some gnolls seem to think that they have much in common with

like to \emph{shape shift} into hyenas. That is why some gnolls fear
that their hyenas might be ghouls. It's a difficult relationship.

Gnomes are small Earth faeries, maybe two or three feet tall. They all
have white hair, a white beard and a tall red hat that adds at least a
foot in height. These gnomes are not related to murderous dwarves
wearing red caps! Gnome women appear not to exist. All couples are
formed by two bearded, white haired gnomes. When asked about their
children, they'll say that they "found" them deep underground. Gnomes
cast spells and can teach them to you, for a
price.\spells{\emph{Speak with animals} (1\st circle) allows you to
  speak with all the animals for 20min. \emph{Stone talk} (2\nd circle)
  allows you to speak with all the animals for 20min. \emph{Earth

  fish through water for two hours. If the spell ends and you are not
  back on the surface, you will slowly suffocate underground,
  immobilized, and nobody will hear you scream.}

Gnomes are known for the ease with which they dig tunnels and their
love for gems. Their underground realms are always lavishly decorated.
Human miners are their worst enemies. Once a gnome realm is
discovered, it will attract a hundred desperadoes looking for riches.
Sometimes the gnomes manage to prevent this by causing cave-ins and
elevator failures as soon as they fear discovery.

All gnomes love animals and speak their language.

Goblins are small creatures of the night. They can see in the dark and
they are good at sneaking around, like halflings. In fact, they
sometimes try to pass themselves off as halflings. They are easily
blinded by sunlight and prefer large hats, leather masks or goggles
when moving around on the surface, however. Goblins have no gender.
They simply crawl out of warm, underground mudpits. The legend of
Bullwrangler says that this hobbit hero drowned in a mudpit and that
Earth Blood keeps creating copies of Bullwrangler. Depending on who is
telling the story, these copies are either corrupted or much improved,
of course.

Goblins love animals, specially the giant and monstrous varieties.
They are able to use them as mounts. This combines goblin intelligence
with giant animal strength. And there will always be enough goblins to
replace a few fallen riders.

Golems are creatures created by powerful magic-users using the spell
\emph{artificial life}.\spells{\emph{Artifical life} (3\rd circle)
  imbues matter with a life of its own, creating a golem. The HD of
  such a golem is limited by the material used and its creator's level
  minus one. A golem needs no rest, no food, no water and no friends.
  It does not sicken or die unless destroyed. Golems do not speak and
  they are a bit dim. They don't use interesting tactics, they can't
  cast spells and they don't use ranged weapons, but they will defend
  their creator at all costs, taking any blows aimed at them, if
  possible. Owning a golem uses a retainer slot or it will malfunction
  and gain independence. You need gems worth at least \SI{100}{gp} to
  bind the magical energies. Spending more just creates a better
  looking golem.} Since they are close to animated objects, they are
\textbf{immune to arrows}, \textbf{immune to poison} and
\textbf{immune to most spells}. They will still stumble on a slippery
slope and they will still burn if they are made of wood, so some
adjudication is required.

All golems are large and strong. They often act as sleepless
guardians, tireless porters and fearless protectors. And since they
don't die, they keep following the orders of their long dead masters.
