\chapter{Principles}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{OSR.png} Old School Renaissance: a game of making
  the most of what you get.
\end{marginfigure}

This book is for the \key{referee} of the game. It is based on the
following principles:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{No Skills}: Be diplomatic or intimidating at the table
  and entertain the other players. Guess where hidden treasure and
  secret doors are based on the clues given.

\item \textbf{Fewer Classes}: There is little mechanical
  differentiation between characters. What matters is personality,
  goals, experiences.\marginnote{We can always add more classes later
    in the game, no problem.}

\item \textbf{Quick Character Generation}: Easy character generation
  with few actual choices speeds things up. A high attrition rate is
  more acceptable if you can bring multiple characters to the table
  and make extras in a minute or two.

\item \textbf{Random Character Generation}: Random character
  generation may surprise players and provide interesting party
  dynamics.\marginnote{Playing with the cards that Fate has dealt you
  is part of the entertainment.}

\item \textbf{Smaller Bonuses}: Smaller bonuses simplify the math
  and produce fewer trickle-down effects. This also makes
  initial ability rolls less important.

\item \textbf{Little Damage, Few Hit Points}: Fewer attacks and
  smaller damage bonuses simplify the math and speed things up.

\item \textbf{Simple Combat}: No explicit rules for combat maneuvers
  and battle grids result in quicker combat rounds, less waiting for
  your turn, and more time to do other stuff---or more fights per
  session, if desired.

\item \textbf{Rare Healing}: Players need to avoid wandering monsters
  and unnecessary fights. This makes strategic decisions (when
  to fight) more important than tactical decisions (how to fight).

\item \textbf{Treasure is Experience}: This encourages players to
  research their goals and pick their fights carefully. It also
  provides an easy and quick reason for the party to form and go
  adventuring.

\item \textbf{No Buying or Selling of Magic Item}: Getting them
  should always involve adventuring.

\item \textbf{Random Encounters, Random Monsters}: This forces the
  referee to improvise and adapt the story on the fly.

\end{enumerate}



\chapter{Running the Game}

\textbf{Keep it short}: character backgrounds, setting history, room
descriptions, monologues -- all your notes should be
short.\marginnote[-1em]{Try to set yourself a time limit for
  preparations in order to avoid burnout. Half an hour for a three
  hour slot is a good place to start.}

\textbf{Use every idea} as soon as possible. Do not save good ideas
for later! Use them now. You will have more good ideas in the future.

\textbf{Be the impartial referee}: Actions have consequences and this
is where you come in. Use your imagination or roll some dice when it
comes to encounters, reactions, treasure, and all that.

\textbf{Be adversarial}: Remember that an adventure requires
opposition. Somebody or something must oppose the player characters or
it isn't interesting. Skip the agreeable parts and focus on the
difficulties.



\section{Dungeons}

\key{Dungeons}: Prepare a number of small dungeons\marginnote{If you
  need some inspiration, check out the
  \href{http://campaignwiki.org/one}{One Page Dungeon Contest}
  submissions. When the party explores one dungeon, use the time to
  make up some events surrounding the other dungeons. Giant frog
  plague? Cultists spreading? Rival party found some treasure?} and
place them on the campaign map. Make note of a few rumors to lead the
party to new dungeons, and provide these rumors to players as both
bait and warnings so that they can prepare for what's coming. This is
a sandbox campaign and the encounters do not depend on the power level
of the party. Instead, the party gets to choose the risk they are
willing to face by going to areas that are more or less dangerous
based on the rumors they hear.

\key{Treasure}: I just roll for random treasure. Treasure spent
earns experience: \SI{1}{gp} is worth 1 XP.\marginnote[-2em]{Expand on the
  list of \emph{buildings} and add cathedrals, tempels, hippodromes
  and the like as your players will need things to spend their gold
  on.}

\key{Magic Items}: I like magic weapons. If I roll up a simple +1
weapon I often pimp it with some extra gimmick.\marginnote{Talking,
  gnawing, cursing, trailing smoke, oozing strange liquids, …} Magic
items are not for sale. Potions can be bought from alchemists. Every
alchemist has a handful of potions they know how to make. They cost
around \SI{500}{gp}.

\index{Stocking}\textbf{Stocking the dungeon}: Use a d20 and roll on
the following table.\marginnote{This is easier than rolling two d6
  which is what
  \href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2013-08-21_One_Roll_Dungeon_Stocking}{Moldvay
    uses}.

\section{Settlements}

\key{Map}: When you
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2011-01-13_Campaign_Start}{create
  a new campaign}, start with
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2009-12-02_Hexcrawl}{a small hex
  map}.\marginnote{Maps are inspiring. They provide a sense of place,
  and every landmark they contain is a potential exploration goal, yet
  another option for players to pursue. Keep a campaign map, hand out
  treasure maps, let other characters draw maps for the party. Players
  need options, and maps are like option tokens. Maps are also props
  that are very easy to make.} You could use the
\href{https://campaignwiki.org/text-mapper}{random hexmap generator},
for example. Only worry about ruins and lairs in the various hexes
once players actually explore the region. This creates an
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2007-02-14_DM_Advice_–_Organic_Campaigns}{organic
  campaign}. Start with the wilderness surrounding a small settlement.

\key{Settlements}: Every settlement has two or three interesting,
named people. These are the people of authority, who the players are
likely to talk to. Every settlement should have a building or two
where these named people can be found, and an inn, or an explanation
for the lack of an inn. Don't bother with a map for the settlement.

\key{People}: Most of civilization consists of neutral, egoistical,
normal humans and appropriate demihumans from the monster manual.
Don't bother assigning levels unless these people are
important.\marginnote{Treat high level humans like monsters with
  special powers: these are the special powers they acquired during
  their many adventures. If you painstakingly create high level
  spell casters with all their spells, your lengthy notes will confuse
  you at the table.}

\medskip
\index{Level!Others}
\begin{tabular}{cp{9cm}}
Level & Role \\
 0 & ordinary people \\
 1 & veterans, trained guards \\
 3 & a leader of up to two dozen people, a watch captain, a bandit boss, a gang leader \\
 5 & a lord over a small settlement, a contested five mile hex, a tower, a small fortress, a sheriff, two of these might be the assistants of a level 9 lord \\
 7 & a leader of a small army, the most powerful chieftain of a tribe, a second in command to a level 9 lord \\
 9 & lord over a town, a castle plus a town or two, multiple villages, a region up to thirty miles in diameter, known up to a hundred miles away
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\key{Names}: Keep multiple lists of names\marginnote{The web is full
  of sites with baby names of various origins. We live in a golden
  age!} to assign to non-player characters.

\key{News}: Gossip, town criers, spies and sages allow you to feed
setting information to your players. Get into the habit of preparing a
little something to report. Actionable information is preferred:
activities of rivals that can be stopped, rumors of treasures that can
be sought. Let players know where to go next if they want to pursue a
certain goal. Provide enough to allow choice but not too much in order
to save preparation time and avoid decision paralysis. Keep the number
of plot hooks somewhere between three and seven. Add new locations to
the map!

\key{Contacts}: Keep a list of contacts.\marginnote{Contacts can move
  around as well. ``You notice a new bard in the Yellow
  Straightjacket. She is called Miela, newly arrived from Halgorn.
  Ilaria appears to have left for Tlan.'' } Magic-users provide new
spells in exchange for ancient books. Sages provide information about
items found in exchange for copies of stone tablets. Drug-abusing
alchemists promise money in exchange for corrupting the law. Rulers
provide men-at-arms in order to get rid of bandits.



\section{Wilderness}

\key{Travel}: The default is one hex traveled per day\marginnote{The
  actual \emph{procedure} at the gaming table is simple: players tell
  you where they want to go. There is a 1 in 6 chance for a daylight
  encounter and a 1 in 6 chance for a nighttime encounter for every
  hex traveled. The encounters will be different between night and
  day, that's why there are two rolls.} unless there are trails or
roads (two per day; no bonus for riding or flying) or they are
traveling by ship along a coast (in which case it'll be eight hexes
per day). As it stands, this ignores movement speeds and hex size. You
travel one hex per day, that's it.

\index{Encounters}\textbf{Random Wilderness Encounters}: Based on the
current area the party is in, jot down a little random encounter
table.\marginnote{If you like floating eye monsters, maybe add a dwarf
  merchant with an extra eye stalk or two to the encounter table. He's
  a spy! If you like frogs, go for an amphibian theme and pick psionic
  frog men, giant frogs, toads, froglings, and so on. If you have a
  theme, consider antagonists. Is the frog faction competing with the
  gnomes? Add a gnome entry!} Consider the critters in the surrounding
dungeons, think of a theme, browse monster manuals and look at
pictures.

Add one or more entries for \textbf{peaceful folk} from the
neighborhood or named people from nearby settlements. Two of these is
a good number. Add these at the top of the list. During the night, add
this number as you roll. This is how you get slightly different
results for day time and night time encounters.\marginnote[2em]{Keep
  using the same table while the player characters are in the same
  region.

  \bigskip\noindent In this example, merchants and soldiers are only
  encountered during the day. At night, add +2 to your roll. Psionic
  frog men and frog demons are only encountered during the night.

  \bigskip\noindent\key{Weather}: If players ask about the weather,
  make an unmodified reaction check and treat it as a description of
  the weather. Alternatively, use a result of 2 on the encounter check
  as an opportunity to say something about the weather. } There is a 1
in 6 chance for a daylight encounter and a 1 in 6 chance for a
nighttime encounter.

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{rl}
d6 & Encounter \\
\sun~1 & merchants (1d6) \\
\sun~2 & soldiers  (1d6+3) \\
  3 & gnomes (1d6+2) \\
  4 & giant frogs (1d4) \\
  5 & froglings (2d6) \\
  6 & giant dragonfly \\
\rightmoon~7 & psionic frog men (2d6) \\
\rightmoon~8 & frog demons (1d4) \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\key{Exploration}: Typically travel is initiated by a non-player
characters telling the player characters about a location. They
provide accurate directions and the location and any landmarks on the
way get placed on the player map. When traveling, player characters
cannot get lost. A hex is big enough for multiple locations (a hill, a
lake, a castle, a village, a dungeon).\marginnote{If you use five mile
  hexes, that's an area of about \SI{22}{mi^2} to search.} Unknown
locations are not easy to find. Use the typical \emph{search}
abilities, one roll per day: 1/6 per day for humans, 2/6 per day for
demihumans.\marginnote{Each search party also gets a separate random
  encounter roll for the day!} Each search party gets one roll. Known
locations can always be found.

\key{Camp}: When there's a nighttime encounter, roll for the
\emph{player} who's in charge: they name the two characters on guard
duty. One of them belongs to them, the other one can be chosen freely.
These two are the only ones wearing armour.\marginnote{Putting on
  armor takes many minutes. You can't do it during a night time
  attack. Sleeping in armour is impossible.}

\key{Lairs}: Many hexes have a building of some sort. Place stuff you
like from material you already have on your map. Add lairs for all the
intelligent monsters on your encounter tables. As time passes, add
more locations and lairs to known hexes. It's simply not possible to
\emph{completely} map a hex. There's always more stuff to discover.
Don't be afraid to add new stuff to existing hexes.

If you have some monsters on your random encounter
table\marginnote{These improvised lairs will necessarily be simple
  one, two or three room affairs. No problem.} and haven't decided
where the lairs of these creatures are, there's a 1 in 6 chance when
encountering them that you have found their lair.



\section{Encounters}

\textbf{Animals}: Remember that most animals don't want to fight.
That's why the list of monsters only include dangerous animals. That
doesn't mean one never encounters deer and birds. Those encounters
just aren't interesting enough to warrant a lot of time at the table.

\textbf{Monsters}: It's easier if monsters announce themselves: let
players find, smell or hear something.\marginnote{Use the
  \emph{reaction roll}. Not all encounters need to end in a fight. Use
  \emph{morale checks} in combat. Not all fights are to the death. Let
  players roll 2d6, since it is their shouting and killing that is
  intimidating their enemies. If the roll beats the monsters' morale
  check, they \emph{flee}. Fleeing grants anybody in melee with them
  an immediate free attack with +2 to hit.

  Here are some typical morale scores:

  \medskip
  \index{Morale!of others}
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    2 & animals that will always run \\
    3 & will fight when cornered \\
    4 & peaceful herbivores \\
    5 & carnivores, cowards \\
    6 & cautious people \\
    7 & normal humans \\
    8 & well led humanoids \\
    9 & disciplined troops \\
    10 & fanatics \\
    11 & lunatics \\
    12 & unnatural creatures \\
  \end{tabular}} This allows them to choose
their approach. Determine encounters before the game starts or have a
procedure to determine the number of monsters encountered ready. Use
1d8 if you're at a loss. This ensures that you're not scaling the
encounter to the players. Let the \emph{players decide} whether to
engage or not.

\textbf{Adapt the encounter} as it happens. If your players are bored,
let the monsters fight. If your players need guidance, have the
monsters talk. If your players are afraid, make it easy to avoid the
encounter. The entertainment of your friends at the table takes
priority. A \emph{total party kill} can be part of it. Know your
players.



\section{Development}

\textbf{Keep Adding}: In order to add life to the world, you need to have two
or three events or changes happen between sessions if time passes
in-game. A lot of it should relate to what the party did. If their dog
was killed by a giant crab and they didn't rescue it, then there will
be a rumor of a ghost dog haunting the beaches. If they discovered
skeletons in a crypt and fled, they have released undead that are now
roaming the neighborhood. If they had hirelings with them, those will
be spreading rumors of a necromancer. Use these rumors to add big and
small adventure options for the players to focus on.

\textbf{Keeping track}: As time passes, you should see a constant
trickle of little ideas to add to your campaign. Prepare for 3–7 of
these potential adventures and keep a list of open plots to remind
players of ongoing issues. More adventures develop wherever the party
shows up. If the party fights a mammoth and decides to track it back
to the forest, then maybe there will be neanderthals living there. If
the players try to contact them, maybe there will be a sabre-toothed
cat and a velociraptor in the area. If they investigate the
velociraptor, they might find a valley full of dinosaurs.

\textbf{Focus Follows Players}: Players express their interest in the
campaign by spending time. If players never leave town, then they want
urban adventures. If they keep returning to your megadungeon, then
that's what they want. Giving players real options ensures that the
game adapts to their preferences (and yours, given that you are
providing the options).



\section{Players}

\textbf{Goals}: Talk to your players about their character goals every
now and then. Identify the players that have interesting goals you'd
like to pursue, and start providing rumors that lead to adventures on
the way to achieving those goals.

Two or three players pushing their own agendas can be a lot of fun.
There will be a little rivalry because each character needs to pursue
their own quests. There will be some cooperation: ``I'll help you
retrieve ice from that glacier for your frost rapier if you will help
me find Xu-Li the fire sage.''

Not everybody needs to have goals! You just need enough player goals
to add adventure seeds to your campaign. If all the players have
divergent goals, they end up having no reason to adventure together.
In that case you might be better off adding a traditional villain to
the mix: a powerful nemesis who sends minions after the player
characters, builds an army to attack their home base, coordinates the
bad guys in the region such that the party absolutely needs to fight.
Just increase the pressure whenever the players start to squabble
again.

\key{Spotlight}: Give enemies the opportunity to shine every now and
then but don't overdo it. Providing a single non-player character the
opportunity to shine in a session is about right.

The same is true for player characters. Emphasize situations where a
player character specifically did something awesome. This lets players
know that you appreciated their character being there and the things
they did. Everybody likes this.

If a player is very entertaining in the game, encourage them.
Non-player characters should go along with a lot of silliness simply
because this is entertaining at the table.\marginnote{Never forget
  that entertainment \emph{at the table} is the point of playing the
  game. We, the humans sitting at the table, want to be entertained.}

Even quiet players like to shine. Sometimes you just have to guess
what makes them tick. Perhaps they'd like romantic success? As the
extroverts grab the spotlight, make sure to interrupt the action once
or twice per session and offer a scene to an introverted player. The
leader is charmed by their presence, the enemy wants to talk to nobody
else but them, the farmers ask them for advice. Don't overdo it.
Sometimes shy players don't want to make big decisions. A public
display of respect or admiration might be enough.

\key{Planning}: If players invest a lot of time into a particular
plan, join in and provide advice---your commentary stands in for their
character's knowledge of the world.\marginnote[-2em]{If you feel that
  they over-planned it, make sure you use words like ``boring wait''
  and ``endless hours pouring over your preparations'' as you remind
  them of the time wasted in-game.} Reward players for the effort by
having their plans succeed. Be sure to recapitulate the successful
execution of the plan, coloring it appropriately. Avoid the evil
feedback loop of foiling their plans.\marginnote{Avoid boring ``it
  doesn't work'' results. Succeed or fail spectacularly.} They'll
counter it by spending even more time planning or by trying to keep
you out of the planning phase. This makes the session boring.

If players don't want to plan a lot, then that's even more awesome,
because it gives you the opportunity to improvise some action scene.
Roll for wandering monsters and go for it.

\key{Background}: Character accomplishments are more interesting than
character abilities. That is why player characters are mechanically
simple. Instead of using attribute or skill checks, let them
negotiate. If a player wants to do something that is out of the
ordinary, ask for an explanation: ``Do you think your character can do
this?'' If the player says yes, then think of an explanation and have
the player write it down on the character sheet. \marginnote{That's
  how we learn that the dwarf has in fact served as a scout and an
  ensign in the dwarven army. Next time a similar question is asked,
  however, the same character probably is not a specialist in
  Elemental Air Summoning and Far Travel.}

\key{Choice}: Hopefully the events at the table shape the characters.
Was the character generous or avaricious? Was the character diplomatic
or rude? Was the character honest or deceitful? That's what you need
all the social encounters for. By interacting with other characters,
players can develop their own character. Therefore, they need to meet
people that can be cheated or dealt with honestly. They need to meet
people that can be robbed and people that beg. It forces players to
make choices regarding their characters. It's how they grow to be more
real.

Avoid situations where there is only one course of action. If you can
only rescue the baron's child, then there's no choice involved. You
should add temptation at every single step. Slavers will be interested
in the child. Enemies of the baron will be interested.

Sometimes there are no obvious choices, and none of the choices help
define the character. The baron's child might not want to return back
home, preferring to go on an adventure instead. The character's choice
will define what they see as filial duty and family integrity. Hardly
any heroic decisions to be made! Use these situations rarely.

\textbf{Influence and Reputation}: Find a way to let player characters
gain influence and reputation through adventuring. This anchors them
in the campaign world and encourages character development instead of
character ability gain. It's a different sort of
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2009-11-24 Rewards}{reward}.

\textbf{Announce consequences} before players commit to
actions.\marginnote{The following list is from
  \href{https://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2011/09/on-ressurecting-quantum-ogre-and-having.html}{the
    Hack \& Slash blog}.} There can only be meaningful choice if
players know what to expect. (``If you fail the roll, you'll […]. Do
you want to risk it?'')

\textbf{Provide information} if players are unsure. You can wrap it in
vague language, but be sure to provide it. (``It's hard to say, but
you feel a nagging suspicion that he's hiding something.'')

\index{Languages}\textbf{Let them talk}.\marginnote{What's the point
  of knowing extra languages? Knowing more language will help you
  overhear conversations, decipher writing, inspire others, negotiate
  directly, feign ignorance, and it grants you some background in
  mythology, history and literature of the culture speaking the
  language.} If monsters have names, that means that they speak a
language. Chances are that at least one of them speaks the common
tongue. Talk to the player characters.

\textbf{Provide warnings} if players are putting themselves in danger.
You're aiming for ``I knew it!'' when something bad befalls player
characters. (``You notice that the hanging bridge above the tar pits
seems frail. Just make sure nobody cuts those ropes!'')

\textbf{Provide alternatives} if you think that what players want
should be impossible. (``You can't just buy a magic weapon but they say
there's a hidden entrance to a goblin market in the Smoke Forest.'')

\textbf{Add obstacles} whenever players are getting what they want.
(``The insect trainer will teach your lizard how to spy ahead if you
provide her with a living giant wasp.'')



\section{Mass Combat}

\textbf{Group combatants into units as you like}. Each player running
one or two units in addition to their player character and retainers
is a good start.

\textbf{Compute total hit points for all units}.\marginnote{40 bandits
  means 40×4.5=\SI{180}{HP}, for example. See the table below for
  quick lookup!} Just multiply the average hit points with the number
of individuals.

\textbf{Combat is very similar to how the rest of the game works.}
Roll for initiative, move, attack, and so on.\marginnote{With one
  important change: in melee, a unit facing multiple opponents attacks
  them \emph{all} at the same time!} AC, movement rate, morale and
saves don't change.

\textbf{Damage dealt is multiplied by the combat scale}. This
simulates the fact that not everybody gets to attack in larger
skirmishes. There are corridors, corners, trees, cover, the press of
bodies, and so on. Conversely, if in contact on multiple sides, the
unit can attack them all as people in the back or on the flanks also
get to act. \marginnote{Don't worry about players changing the sizes
  of their units once they learn of this table as they try and
  maximize their combat scale for the first
  attack.}\marginnote[3em]{40 bandits have a combat scale of ×6. If
  they hit and roll a 4 for damage, they actually deal 4×6 = 24
  damage. With just one more bandit, the combat scale would go up to
  ×7. Bad luck, bandits!}

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}
Number & Scale & HD~1 & HD~2 & HD~3  & HD~4 & HD~5 \\
2--5   & ×3    &   22 &   45 &    90 &   180 &   360 \\
6--10  & ×4    &   45 &   90 &   180 &   360 &   720 \\
11--20 & ×5    &   90 &  180 &   360 &   720 &  1440 \\
21--40 & ×6    &  180 &  360 &   720 &  1440 &  2880 \\
41--80 & ×7    &  360 &  720 &  1440 &  2880 &  5760 \\
81--160 & ×8   &  720 & 1440 &  2880 &  5760 & 11520 \\
161--320 & ×9  & 1440 & 2880 &  5760 & 11520 & 23040 \\
321--640 & ×10 & 2880 & 5760 & 11520 & 23040 & 46080 
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\textbf{When you're hit, adjust your combat scale}.\marginnote{If 40
  bandits have 53 hit points left, then there are $53 / 4.5 \approx
  12$ thieves left (round up). The combat scale of these thieves drops
  to ×5. To speed things up, refer to the table above: For HD~1
  bandits, 53 is more than 45, so there are 11–20 bandits left and
  their combat scale is ×5.} Divide the remaining hit points by the
average hit points per individual (round up) to see how many are still
alive.

\textbf{Player characters can ``hide'' within a unit}, granting them
their charisma bonus for morale checks. When the unit takes damage,
the player and their retainers are the last ones to actually take
damage. They still attack as usual, with separate attack rolls and
separate spell casting actions.

\textbf{Spells works as they usually do}.\marginnote{Ten HD~1 bandit
  falling asleep is thus the equivalent of 10×4.5 damage.} Convert
\emph{sleep} or \emph{charm person} spells to damage such as to
simulate how it takes out unit members. For a \emph{lightning bolt} or
\emph{fireball}, just apply the damage\marginnote{If a fireball hits
  goblins, more of them are hit but each goblin can only take as much
  damage as it has hit-points so we're assuming it all evens out. Roll
  just one saving throw for the unit.} to the unit and ignore how many
unit members would actually get caught in the area of effect.

\textbf{Every unit must make a morale check when it loses its first
  member, and another when it loses half its members}. This is
important! Such a unit is considered \emph{broken}. They hunker down
and disengage.

\textbf{A player character or retainer within a broken unit may
  attempt to rally the unit}. Only one character per round may try
this. If rallying fails, try again next round. Either way, the unit
does not get to act this round.

\textbf{If a broken unit suffers any damage, it will rout.} A routed
unit must flee the battle field and any other unit in melee range gets
a free extra attack with a +2 bonus.



\chapter{Gods \& Demons}

The gods and demons are important because players are able to
visit their \emph{halls}. These can be reached by secret \emph{gates}
when sailing the \key{Astral Sea}, or when climbing the branches of the
\emph{World Tree}\marginnote{The World Tree is
  \hiref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil}{Yggradsil}. In
  certain locations, the planar boundaries are weakened and it is
  possible to enter a sacred grove or push through a thorny hedge and
  find yourself on one of the branches of the World Tree. The ground
  is made of living wood. Most often it is steep. There are leaves and
  branches everywhere, secondary growth, birds, insects, anything that
  flies. If you are pushed off the branch and you can't fly, you're
  dead. If the gate is popular, people will have added ropes, ladders,
  stairs, bridges. Soon enough it is a confusing, living labyrinth of
  passages. Unless you know where the gates are it will take you a
  week to find a random gate.

  To learn more, start with the Wikipedia article on
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_cosmology}{Norse
    cosmology}.} connecting all the planes of existence.

There is a chance that the gods will send one of their agents to help
if their name is called. In order to succeed, players need to keep
track of \textbf{a score for each god} they care about. As characters
do things to honor or spite the various gods, their score goes up.
This could be about saving or killing their followers, building altars
and temple in their name, defiling their altars or acting on visions
sent by them. This score is the percent chance that the god will act
when their name is called. Whether the agents appearing will in fact
help the characters depends on their past actions. An evil demon lord
like Set might still send a naga to help a paladin of Mitra, hoping to
mess with them. The score only goes down if you ignore the gods.

When paladins and clerics cast \textbf{spells of level four and
  higher}, the spell effect usually involves the appearance of such an
agent and an opportunity for some discourse arises.

\hyperref[animal:Boar]{boars}, of magic. Her valkyries and collects
half the slain in battle. These dine with her in \key{Sessrúmnir}, her
hall in Asgard.

Odin is the god of wisdom, of magic and poetry, of war, of eagles and
ravens, of runes, of wanderers. He wields a magic spear, he raises the
dead, he rides an eight legged horse called Sleipnir. The other half
of the slain in battle dine with him in \key{Valhalla}, his hall in
Asgard.

In times of need, both of them send a

lies, of deceit, of misdeeds, of excuses and explanations, of looking
the other way, of tricksters, thieves and shape changers, a friend of
giants, the innocently accused, the misunderstood and the innocent. He
can be found brooding in his hall \key{Utgard} in Jötunheim.

In times of need, he might send \hyperref[sec:doppelgänger]{shape

\section{Thor}
\label{sec:thor}
\index{Thor}

Thor is the god of storms, of lightning and thunder. He is also famed
for his strength, but that is mostly due to him wielding his famous
hammer, and wearing his belt of power and his iron gauntlets. His hall
\key{Bilskirnir} stands in \hyperref[key:Asgard]{Asgard}.

In times of need, he will send a mighty thunderstorm. Lightning will
split trees and set houses on fire, debris will fly through the air
and kill anybody out in the open, there will be landslides and
flooding. Whether this actually helps those in need is immaterial. This
is the help they will get. Anybody out in the open takes 6d6 damage;
save vs.~death for half.

\section{The Nine Realms}
\label{sec:realms}
\index{Realms}

Thus we have seen some of the nine realms, all of them connected via
the world tree, Yggradsil.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Asgard, the city of the gods: blue sky, eternal midday, golden
  roofed halls, an island in the astral sea, a rainbow bridge for the
  gods to travel from realm to realm
\item Alfheim, the realm of elves: blue sky, eternal golden hour, huge
  trees, sparkling cities with floral decorations
\item Midgard, the realm of the humans: blue sky, red sunsets,
  mountains, forests, plains, deserts, rivers, lakes, oceans, the
  world we know
\item Myrkheim (or Svartalfheim), the underground realm of dwarves:
  eternal night, caves, mines, goblins, giant spiders, mushrooms,
\item Jötunheim, the realm of ice and frost giants: black sky and dark
  clouds, eternal shadow, glaciers, mountains, frozen rivers, ice
  bergs and the ocean
\item Vanaheim, the hidden realm of the old gods: red sky, blue
  sunsets, rust deserts, deep green valleys
\item Niflheim (or Hel), the realm of fog and mist: grey sky, white
  snow, dark forests, trolls, wolves
\item Muspelheim, the realm of lava and fire giants: black sky, red
  haze, volcanoes and a sea of flames
\end{enumerate}

The nature of the ninth realm remains unknown.

\index{Hit Dice|see {HD}}\key{HD} are hit dice; roll as many d8 to
determine hit points (\index{Hit Points|see {HP}}\key{HP}) unless
those are indicated. A +1 or +2 means that you should add this many HP
and that the monster attacks as if it had one HD more.

\index{Armor|see {AC}}\key{AC} is armour class and determines how hard
it is to hit (lower is better).

For monsters to hit, roll a d20 and add their hit dice. For an orc
with 1 hit die to hit another orc with armour class 14, roll 1d20+1;
on a 14 or more, this is a hit.

The \key[Attack]{attacks} and the \key[Damage]{damage} they do are
listed next, e.g.~1d6/1d6 means the creature has two attacks, each
dealing 1d6 damage.

\key{Saving Throw} is a letter indicating the class to use (F is the
default: fighter) and the level to use. This is usually the same as
their hit dice.\marginnote{In fact, in a pinch just use the creature's
  hit dice as their saving throw.} Animals usually save at half their
hit dice, magical creatures at double their hit dice (max 19).

\index{Movement|see {MV}}\key{MV} is the movement rate in SI{10}{ft/round},
or in inch/round on a battle map. Often a note is added to explain
unusual values, eg. MV~15 (fly) means it flies SI{150}{ft/round}.

\index{Morale|see {ML}}\key{ML} is the morale score. If you roll 2d6
higher than this, morale breaks and the remaining creatures retreat or
flee.

\index{Experience Points|see {XP}}\key{XP} are the experience points
gained upon slaying this creature. This is simply HD × 100.

\textbf{Names} indicate that the creature can speak.

\key{Animals} fear fire and aren't intelligent.

\key{Mounts} are creatures that can carry somebody on their back.
Mounts attack somebody that is attacking them in melee. They prefer
not to fight. If their owner dies in combat, a mount is \emph{free}
and tries to flee. You can \emph{take over} a mount by taking their
rider's place. Anybody can jump onto a horse and ride it!

\key{Pets} are \emph{friends}. Pets will attack anybody you are
attacking and they will attack anybody attacking you. If a pet's owner
dies, they go \emph{feral}. They defend their owner's corpse against
both friends and enemies. Taking over a pet requires you to befriend
them (make a reaction roll, feed them for a +1 on the roll).

Both mounts and pets take a \emph{retainer slot}. Unlike ordinary
retainers, they do not gain levels. Neither will take a blow for you,

The basilisk is the ``little king of serpents''---it's a monstrous
snake ten paces long and nearly chest high at its thickest. The
basilisk's scales are usually green or brown, and upon its head it
wears a crown of gold. Its lair is filled with toxic fumes, a deadly
poison to all. Its breath poisons the air for \SI{30}{ft} around it.
\textbf{When you breathe in these fumes}, save vs.~poison or die. You
can hold your breath for one round and fight. If you keep fighting,
save vs.~death or faint. Once you faint, your body starts
breathing again, at which point you must save vs.~poison or die.
Its gaze also kills; such is the power of its poisonous spirit.
\textbf{If it sees you}, and you did not have to save vs.~poison this
round, do so now or die. And finally, if you manage to approach the
basilisk without being slain by its stench or gaze, you still have to
survive it poisonous fangs. \textbf{If you are hit}, and you did not
have to save vs.~poison this round, do so now or die.

cockatrice. It never mates.

Don't be fooled by their name. These bees are omnivorous and kill
sheep and halflings for food. \textbf{When stung}, save vs.~poison or
die. These stings are solid. The bee does not die after having stung
its victim.

settlements, sometimes making their lair in the ruins of once rich and
powerful towns and cities.

They have seen it all. Their heart is bent on destruction. Collecting
the treasures of the cities they sacked is their way of preventing a
reconstruction.

\marginnote{Most spell casters of the polymorph traditions prefer to
  \emph{shape shift} into dragons when in danger. As this spell
  belongs to the 4\th circle, this means that most elves pick the

Elephants let your players know that they're no longer in a region

battle, they trample their victims to a pulp. \textbf{When fighting
  humans or smaller creatures} (anything that's not a giant, really),
they get +4 to their attack rolls.\marginnote{In general, elephants
  don't enjoy charging armies so training them for war is a long and
  cruel undertaking. Don't do it!} Seeing an elephant for the first
time requires a morale check by their enemies and their mounts or
they'll flee the battle field. An elephant will carry three people
without a \emph{howdah} or castle on its back. With a castle
(\SI{500}{gp}), up to ten people can be carried. You can also mount a
ballista on an elephant's castle instead (\SI{500}{gp}, 2d6
damage\marginnote{See
  \href{http://lost.spelljammer.org/ShatteredFractine/shipyard/siegeweapons.html}{Spelljammer

elephant's AC can be increased to 16 for \SI{1000}{gp}. \textbf{When
  an elephant is reduced to less than 10 hit point}, a morale check is
required or it goes \emph{berserk}, attacking both friend and foe.

don't use interesting tactics, they can't cast spells and they don't
use ranged weapons, but they defend their creator at all costs, taking
any blows aimed at them, if possible. Owning a golem uses a retainer

Horses are the favorite \textbf{mounts} of humans. From steppe
warriors armed with bows to armored knights with lances, they all use
horses for mobility. Over many days, traveling by horse is more
comfortable than moving on foot, but in general it's not much faster
than marching on foot unless you can change horses along the way. They
need time to cool down, to recover, to eat and to digest.

In large battles, cavalry is deadliest when the enemy is fleeing. It's
hard to force a horse to charge armed lines of soldiers.

When attacking people on foot from horseback, you need a long weapon
like a spear or a long sword, or a short bow. Once you're in melee,
the horse will also attack with its hooves.

with a burning torch whenever a head is chopped off. A torch
cauterizes the wound without dealing additional damage.

as much damage as the hydra has hit points, save vs.~dragon breath for

Manticores are bitter old men that turned into monsters: haters are

lion-like creatures with dragon wings and a spiked tail. Manticores
keep their old, bearded human faces but the hair grows wild and the
jaws grow stronger. These bitter old men just keep on hating: they
hate the spikes regrowing like shark teeth, they hate their old towers
fallen to ruin, they hate the villagers, they hate pilgrims, they hate
everybody. And now they have the body act upon it.

They can let fly up to six \textbf{spikes} per round, shooting them at
anybody within \SI{60}{ft}. They have 24 spikes and thus they can keep

\caves{Marid}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Marid.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

The marid are lords of water, the personifications of floods, tsunamis
and avalanches. They are black like the darkest ocean and their
presence dims all light like an approaching storm.

\begin{quote}
HD~12 AC~19 3d6 F20 MV~24 ML~12 XP~1200; \emph{water}, \emph{fog},
\emph{rain}, \emph{flood} and \emph{destruction} at will; magic required
to hit
\end{quote}

A marid can be summoned from \hyperref[key:Niflheim]{Niflheim} using
the spell \emph{summoning a lord of water} (5\th circle). When first
cast, it creates a link between the caster and a random marid.
Subsequent castings summon the same marid until one of
you dies. Sorcerer kings of old have sometimes used \emph{entrapment
  of ethereal bodies} (5\th circle) to transfer that bond to an objects
in order to imprison the marid. Some of these prison rings, lamps and
jars still survive. Don't forget to make a reaction check when freeing
such a marid!

A typical marid prison object has a minuscule gate to a watery
demiplane inside it. If you can pass through the tiny opening and if
you can breath underwater, you too can enter this hidden palace. If
somebody plugs the hole while you're inside, though—you know the
feeling! That's why an marid is usually loath to reenter it once
freed.

\textbf{Spells}: They have the natural ability to cast spells and can
teach them to you, for a price. The weather changes brought about by a
marid last for several days without a renewal being required.

\emph{Water} (1\st circle) creates a natural water source where clean
drinking water can be had for \SI{1}{h/level}.

\emph{Fog} (2\st circle) summons forth a supernatural fog that spreads
in all directions for \SI{1}{h/level}, limiting sight to a few feet.
Within the fog, ranged attacks and all spells that require a visible
target are therefore limited to a range of but a few feet. This also
works underground and within buildings.

\emph{Rain} (3\rd circle) summons forth a rain cloud that spreads in
all directions. This only works outside. The heavy rain soon turns
the ground to mud. All stones are slippery, all rivers are swollen,
are fords impassable, travel comes to a standstill. The rain lasts for
\SI{1}{h/level} and the mud takes as many days to dry up.

\emph{Flood} (4\th circle) results in supernatural swell in a nearby
body of water. A lake, a river, an ocean, anything large enough that
can only be crossed with difficulty is good enough. Such a flood tears
down any wooden structures: houses, palisades, bridges, they are all
swept away, dams break, rivers overflow, flatlands are drowned.
Anything standing on its legs eventually gets swept away and if you
can't swim, save vs.~death once per round or die. You can't swim in
metal armour. A flood is swiftest next to its source, but as the water
spreads out the flood is slowed. Then again, if the flood is sent down
a small valley, the water races downhill until it runs into a bigger
body of water. The water flows continue for \SI{1}{h/level}.

\emph{Destruction} (5\th circle) is an undoing of creation. A blast of
rain, snow, hail from a rip in structure of the universe will flatten
any building within minutes and kill any creature within it unless it
saves vs.~death. The roiling clouds, the earth tremors and the
electrical discharges around the rip will continue for hours but the
destruction itself is wrought instantaneously. The use of such strong
magic, this tampering with the very framework of reality, attracts
other elemental creatures trying to right the imbalance:
\hyperref[sec:ifrit]{afarit}, \hyperref[sec:ghoul]{ghouls} or
\hyperref[sec:jinni]{jinn}, for example.

\textbf{Numbers}: 1. Typically somebody has summoned it, or bound it
to an object and what you're actually finding is the object itself.

of a Million Souls, Slow Suffocation, Eels Eating Your Eyes.

Medusas are creatures cursed by a desperate need for love and yet

their hair must save vs.~petrification or \textbf{turn to stone}.
Blind fighting or using a mirror to fight incurs the usual penalty of
-4 to hit.

Approaching a medusa also allows the snakes on her head to attack.
Their bite is \textbf{poisonous} and leads to death in \SI{10}{min}.

Note that there is no known way to turn petrified creatures back to
flesh.\marginnote{That's because this game is limited to spells up to
  the 5\th circle. Everything else is divine
  intervention.} And worse: since petrified victims are not really
dead, their soul remain imprisoned in their stone bodies for all

and washing them away into the sea, or letting the acid and rain erode
it away to nothingness is the only way to free those imprisoned souls.

Minotaurs are cow people. They are broad and strong, with great horns

research such spells.

\emph{Mental Maze} (3\rd circle) acts as a confusing area effect
extending \SI{300}{ft} in all directions. Anybody entering the area
must save vs.~spells or soon leave it again, not having found what
they were looking for.

\emph{Hedge Maze} (4\th circle) grows plants until they create a
physical maze extending \SI{300}{ft} in all directions after
\SI{1}{h}. The hedge remains and cannot be dispelled. If the magic is
dispelled, the hedge slowly withers and dies over the coming week. The
thorny walls are \SI{20}{ft} high and difficult to burn and hard to
cross. It's much easier to search the maze, given that there is always
a way to reach its centre.

\emph{Stone Maze} (5\th circle) raises a stone maze from the ground

Mummies are ancient sorcerer kings which their descendants saw fit to
preserve for their knowledge and wisdom. But after a hundred years or
more their dynasty has failed, their descendants are dead, but they
are still around, their opinion not wanted, their advice not heeded,
their tombs no longer guarded. Some of them might still welcome
visitors from the dark recesses of their burial chambers, offering
ancient advice and knowledge, but most are simply filled with cold
hate, robbed of their spell casting powers of old, fallen from grace,
preserved for an eternal afterlife that never came.

Anybody who sees them must save vs.~paralysis or be \textbf{held}.
This hold disappears if the victim can no longer see the mummy or if
the mummy attacks anybody.\marginnote{Blind fighting incurs a -4
  penalty.} Mummies holding their victims will leave the killing to
the rest of their family or other undead minions unaffected by their
power.

to save vs.~paralysis or be unable to move, experiencing a cold hand
squeezing their heart and the shrivelling of their eyes, their tongue,
their intestines. A held person will not drop anything and remain
standing, staring at you in utter fear. Attacking anybody or leaving

Giant worms have grown to lengths of \SI{30}{ft}, \SI{100}{ft} and
more under the influence of Earth Blood. When rolling a 19 or more on
their attack roll, a worm will \textbf{swallow} its victim. All
swallowed victims are dealt automatic damage every round until they
are dead, or the worm is dead. Inside the worm, only a dagger may be
used and all attack rolls take a -4 penalty.

Wraiths are restless incorporeal undead. In their underground crypts,
these malevolent spirits rise whenever a living creature approaches.
There they hiss their last commands and whisper their unchanging
curses, trapped in endless loops of hate and anger. Whomsoever they
stab with their shadow swords is immediately \textbf{drained of a

  this new hit point maximum if it is lower than their previous

Zombies are animated human corpses. They are stupid cannibals, always
looking to eat some human flesh. They barely remember their names,
their past life and mumble incoherently as they are pulled along by
their necromantic masters.

\begin{quote}
HD~2 AC~12 1d8 F1 MV~12 ML~12 XP~200; unaffected by \emph{sleep},
\emph{charm}, and other such mind affecting spells
\end{quote}

\textbf{Spells}: Usually zombies are created on battlefields by
necromancers. There, the newly slain provide the raw material these
foul magic users require.

\emph{Raise zombies} (3\rd~circle) animates a fresh human corpse per
level. Zombies wield no weapons and wear no armor. They will follow
you and obey any simple command.\marginnote{In practice, a simple
  command is usually a single word like ``stand!'' or ``charge!''}
Zombies continuously rot and disintegrate within a week or two.

\textbf{Numbers}: 4d6. Remember, where there are zombies, a
necromancer cannot be far off.\marginnote{Necromancers aren't battle
  mages. A typical spell selection for a 5\th level necromancer: 1\st
  circle: sleep, fear; 2\nd circle: eternal darkness, read thoughts;
  3\rd circle: raise zombies. They probably own magic items, too: 25\%
  per item type.}

\chapter{Treasure}

\textbf{Treasure is Experience}.\marginnote{When a big chunk of XP is
  provided via treasure, fighting turns into a strategic decision:
  when is it worth to risk a fight? And it makes alternative
  approaches more rewarding: tricking a dragon makes more sense than
  fighting it.} Providing enough treasure is important for the party
to gain levels. How quickly should the party gain levels? It's hard to
provide good numbers. If your players are frustrated, you might need
to add more treasure. I like to run a campaign for fifty sessions or
more. Assuming the campaign ends with characters on level ten, that
means it took them about five sessions per level. Instead of handing
out more treasure than provided for in these tables, consider
providing more treasure in a different form:

\begin{packed}
\item stealing a ship\marginnote{This sort of treasure isn't listed in
  the treasure tables below!} that is worth \SI{50000}{gp} would
  provide as much XP when it is lost (given away, sunk, stolen)
\item conquering a well maintained keep worth \SI{75000}{gp} would
  provide as much XP when it is lost (given away, lost in a siege)
\end{packed}

\textbf{Treasure distribution is not fair}. If treasure isn't parceled
out in small chunks and isn't gained in regular intervals, but found
rarely and in big chunks, then it works a bit like a slot
machine:\marginnote{When such design patterns are abused, they are
  addictive. Signs of addiction are the inability to stop even though
  you want to, abandoning friends and family, the inability to
  maintain normal social ties. All of this isn't true when you're
  simply playing in a regular role-playing group so I wouldn't worry
  about it.} the reward is rare and hard to predict and thus players
might feel a strong urge to be there for every session, and such large
hoards become part of the oral tradition of the campaign as players
keep talking about it.

\textbf{Roll for treasure}. Players might get a lot of treasure, but
they might also get nothing at all. Beating a dragon is not a
guarantee of a rich reward. Players need to determine whether the
particular dragon they are targeting does in fact have a big
hoard.\marginnote{If it doesn't, I hope the players are at least doing
  it for the right reasons and not for material gain and personal
  advancement.} This encourages players to gather information and to
scout, both of which make the game more interesting and the decision
to risk a fight a strategic one.

\textbf{Magic items come in various types}:\marginnote{If a monster
  description says ``5\% per level per item type,'' then this means a
  level 3 leader would have a 15\% chance each for a magic weapon, a
  magic armour, a scroll, a potion, a wondrous item, as well as a
  treasure map.} magic weapons, magic armour, scrolls, potions,
wondrous items, as well as treasure maps -- six categories.

\textbf{Personalize magic items}. Where possible, a few names are
given in the sidebar. If an elven \emph{dagger} +1 is found, you might
describe it as ``a beautiful dagger, the hilt is a piece of wood
shaped like a small treant and the blade is engraved with an oak leaf
patterns and the name of its maker: Maeglin.''

\section{Treasure Maps}

Maps point to a location nearby where more \emph{unguarded} treasure
can be found (although the location itself might very well be unsafe).

\begin{packed}
\item map to the hidden crypt of an old magic user\marginnote{Names:
  Glanmor, Arthen, Enfys, Mona, Gwenllian, Brisen, Cynfarch}
  with the promise of 1d12×SI{1000}{gold} coins to be found
\item map to the hidden ancestral shrine of an elf\marginnote{Elf
  names: Aderthaëth, Theriail, Narchaor, Celaidil, Goluion, Húrion,
  Nodnenui, Aníraor, Lothwen} with the promise of 1d6×SI{1000}{gold} coins
  to be found
\item map to the hidden ancestral shrine of a dwarf\marginnote{Dwarf
  names: Kára Axebearer, Motspori Shieldmaker, Bettí Stoneeater} with
  the promise of 1d10×SI{1000}{gold} coins to be found
\item map to 2d6 jewels hidden in a dwarven forge\marginnote{Forge
  names: Moonlight, Grindeater, Hammer, High Anvil, Skyfather}
\end{packed}

\section{Treasure Types}

All monsters are assigned a \textbf{treasure type}.

\textbf{None}: Some creatures don't have a fixed lair and don't
collect shiny baubles (bear, giant bee, giant beetle, boar, large cat,
centaur, giant crab, crocodile, elephant, giant fish, giant goat,
golem, hellhound, horse, ifrit, jinni, invisible stalker, jinni, giant
lizard, marid, pegasus, pixie, giant scorpion, sea serpent, shark,
skeleton, giant snake, giant squid, swamp crane, giant toad, unicorn,
giant weasel, valkyrie, vulture demon, wolf, giant worm, zombie). They
have no treasure.

\textbf{Poor}: Intelligent creatures that live in ruins, finding the
things others have left behind (giant apes, doppelgänger, frogling,
gargoyle, gnoll, goblin, kappa, lycanthrope, minotaur, myconid, nixie, giant
spider, treant). These have very little treasure.

\textbf{Average}: Creatures that live in settlements (halfling, human,
lizard people, warlocks). These have a lot of silver and gold coins,
but few platinum coins, gems, jewelry, or magic items.

\textbf{Rich}: Creatures that get presents from others (giant, gnome,
rakshasa, vampire). They have a lot of coin but also gems, jewelry and
magic items.

\textbf{Robber}: Creatures that rob merchants and travellers (ettin,
hobgoblin, manticore, ogre, orc, troll). They tend to have a lot of
silver and gold coins, and some gems, but few jewelry, magic items and
no platinum coins.

\textbf{Ancient}: Creatures that are remnants of ancient empires (elf,
spectre). These have mostly platinum coins, gems, jewelry and magic
items.

\textbf{Scout}: Creatures travelling in small groups (bugbear, tengu).
These may have some magic items and some platinum coins, but very
little else.

\textbf{Terror}: Creatures with magical powers cursing the land
(basilisk, chimera, gorgon, harpy, hydra, medusa, naga, salamander,
shadow). These treasures have a lot of magic items because of all the
failed heroes that tried to kill them.

\textbf{Dead}: The graves yield what people bury with their dead, mostly
coins and jewelry (creeper, ghoul, mummy, wight, wraith).

The following monsters have unique treasures:

\textbf{Dragon}: They actively seek out treasure, destroying
settlements of others and looting them. And their servants bring them
gifts. They have everything.

\textbf{Dwarf}: They actively seek out treasure, digging deep and
plundering as they go. They also have everything.



\chapter{Names}

Many treasure items were created by legendary magic users, elves and
dwarves. That is why it's important to have lots of names of for these
legendary elves and dwarves. Surely their names can still be found
inscribed into the magic items they created.

I also like to use different lists to pick all the names of ancient
magic users, devils, dwarves, elves, halflings and humans, and so on.
