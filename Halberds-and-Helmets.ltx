This is the player handbook for my campaigns. We play classic D\&D
using rules from the early eighties.\marginnote{Ownership of the rules
  is optional. If you want to dig deeper, I recommend
  \href{http://www.rpgnow.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic}{Basic
    D\&D by Moldvay} and
  \href{http://www.rpgnow.com/product/110792/DD-Expert-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic}{Expert
    D\&D by Cook} (from the early eighties),
  \href{https://necroticgnome.com/}{Old-School Essentials}
  (compatible, with new layout) or
  \href{http://goblinoidgames.com/index.php/downloads/}{Labyrinth
    Lord} (free).} My campaigns usually last for around fifty short
sessions of around two hours each and end before player characters
reach level ten, which is why the information for higher level player
characters is missing.

The rules offer \textbf{very little mechanics}: there aren't many
classes to choose from, no feats, no prestige classes and hardly any
special abilities or skills, no magic items for sale. Furthermore,
elves, dwarves and halflings are simply separate classes. There are no
elven thieves or dwarven mages. On the other hand, fewer rules also
leave \textbf{a lot of freedom} for players. The characters are as
diplomatic, friendly or intimidating as the players want them to be.

We're playing in a
\href{http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox}{sandbox}.
There is \textbf{no planned ending} for the campaign. The actions of
player characters determines the directions the campaign grows
in.\marginnote{Players determine where the campaign will head. If
  player characters investigate rumors and locations, I will develop
  the game world in that direction. The harder you look, the more
  there is to see.}

There are \textbf{no clerics} in my game and I use \textbf{restricted
  spell acquisition} for magic users and elves: finding scrolls and
spell books does not allow you to master those spells. You need a
teacher. At the same time, the slow introduction of new spells change
the game over time. This is a journey \textbf{from zero to hero}.

To keep fights interesting (and short), the more dangerous monsters
use poison, level drain, spells, and other \textbf{save or die}
effects.

Dangers are not adapted to the strength of the party. Generally
speaking it's safer near civilized settlements. The further you move
into the wilderness, the more dangerous it is. That's how
\textbf{players control the risks they want to take}.

Preparation and experience should help you avoid situations, where
your character's survival depends on a single die roll.\marginnote{The
  game will remain dangerous for a long time. At very low levels
  limited hit points mean you'll die if you get hit. Later, around
  level five and six, it's still easy to die because of spells like
  \emph{fireball} or \emph{lightning bolt}, poisonous critters and
  petrifying gases, or level drain. At higher level, when the first
  characters hit level eight and nine, the game will be less dangerous
  and involve more reaction rolls and larger battles, but then again,
  the characters will soon retire from adventuring…} If you're rolling
dice, it's already too late. \textbf{A saving throw is your last
  chance} to survive due to luck and experience. Ideally you would
never have to roll dice because you're well informed and well equipped.
Perseus didn't have to save against the medusa's petrifying gaze
because \emph{he was well prepared}.

\textbf{Followers are another safeguard against character death}:
torch bearers, men-at-arms and war dogs all cost money, but they will
also keep your character alive. Should player characters die, the next
character is most probably going to be one of their
\hyperref[sec:followers]{followers}.

\textbf{Experience points} are gained by defeating opponents and by
\textbf{spending gold} you gained on adventures.\marginnote{Spending
  gold on public \hyperref[sec:buildings]{buildings} is one way of
  spending a lot of money.} If you manage to obtain the gold without
combat, good for you. The best strategy is to pick your battles and
stack the odds in your favor as far as possible. Remember, if you're
rolling dice, it's already too late.

\section{\index{Character}Character Creation}
\label{sec:charactercreation}

\marginnote{A short summary for players:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item roll for your six attributes
  \item choose your class
  \item choose first spell, if any
  \item copy your attack values for level 1
  \item copy your saving throws for level 1
  \item roll for hit points
  \item choose alignment
  \item roll for money
  \item buy equipment
  \end{enumerate}
}

Every player needs at least one character. You can skip character
creation by using the
\href{https://campaignwiki.org/halberdsnhelmets/random/en?rules=halberds-n-helmets}{online
  character generator}. If you want to invest the time necessary,
start with an empty sheet of paper or print a character sheet in
\href{http://campaignwiki.org/Charactersheet.pdf}{portrait} or
\href{http://campaignwiki.org/Charactersheet-landscape.pdf}{landscape}
orientation.

\newthought{Roll 3d6 in order} for your \index{Attributes}attributes.

\marginnote{When using \emph{ranged weapons}, the damage you roll
  remains unchanged. This is good for weak characters and bad for
  strong characters.

\bigskip\noindent Each score comes with a \index{Bonus}bonus:
\smallskip

\begin{tabular}{cc}
Score & Bonus \\
3 & -3 \\
4–5 & -2 \\
6–8 & -1 \\
9–12 &  \\
13–15 & +1 \\
16–17 & +2 \\
18 & +3
\end{tabular}
}

\key{Strength} allows you to carry more and to hit harder. Add the
bonus to your to-hit rolls and to your damage rolls when using
\emph{melee weapons}.

\key{Dexterity} allows you to aim better and to better avoid attacks.
Add the bonus to your to-hit roll when using \emph{ranged weapons}
(but not to your damage rolls) and subtract the bonus from your
\hyperref[key:To-Hit]{armor class} (lower is better).

\key{Constitution} determines your health. Add the bonus to every
\hyperref[key:Hit Points]{hit die} (but never reduce a hit die below 1).

\key{Intelligence} determines your education. If you have a positive
bonus, it indicates how many extra \hyperref[key:Languages]{languages}
you speak.

\key{Wisdom} determines how much in tune with the world you are, and
how well immortals \hyperref[key:Reaction Roll]{react} to you. Add the
bonus to your \hyperref[key:Saving Throw]{saving throws}.

\key{Charisma} determines how well other mortals
\hyperref[key:Reaction Roll]{react} to you, how many
\hyperref[sec:followers]{followers} you can have (4 + your bonus) and
their \hyperref[key:Morale Check]{morale} (7 + your bonus).

\label{sec:followers}

The number of followers for your player character is
limited:\marginnote{You'll have to decide at the table whether players

\hyperref[key:Hirelings]{hirelings} and

\key{Mounts} (like horses) and \key{Pets} (like war
dogs)\marginnote{Anybody can buy a horse or a war dog. All other
  retainers must be the same level or lower, however: it's not easy to
  tame a griffon or a tiger.} also count as followers. Unlike people
they don't expect payment, they don't gain experience points, and they
can’t use tactics.

\key{Retainers} are regular player characters: fighters, magic users,
thieves, elves, halflings, and dwarves.\marginnote{If your player
  character dies in an adventure, one of your retainers gets turned
  into your player character; if you have none left, a hireling or
  porter gains a level of fighter, magic user, or thief.} When they
get hired, they are first level characters. They gain experience
points like a player character: by defeating opponents and spending
money. \index{Gold!Retainers}Retainers spend their money as quickly as
possible. Characters and retainers can gift or lend each other gold
for this purpose, but one cannot accept gifts or borrow from anybody
with a lower level.

Retainers get half a share\marginnote{The
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_code}{pirate code} worked
  the same way: the captain gets two shares, i.e.\ double of what
  their retainers get.} of all treasure found. If retainers don't get
their fair share, or if the last adventure was a disaster, they need
to make a \hyperref[key:Morale Check]{morale check}. Their morale is 7
+ your charisma bonus. If they roll higher than that, they retire.

\marginnote{For each candidate, roll a d12: 1 – fighter, 2 – magic

not attract more candidates.

The \key[Law]{Priests of Law} say: ``Alone we are weak and life is a
valley of tears. Together we are strong. Together we build our homes.
Together we till our fields. Together we defend our towns and
villages. Together are we strong.

We build dams against the flood. We build aqueducts against the
drought. We build canals against the plague. We drain the swamps and
push back the fever. We fill our granaries and defeat famine.

We punish treachery and reward loyalty. We ensure law and justice.
Even if the corruption of chaos and anarchy are on the rise, we have
our heavenly order from the highest gods in heaven down to the lowest
devils in hell. They make sure that punishment and rewards are not
forgotten—not now and not for all eternity.

In our world, everybody has a place and there is a place for
everybody—including you. See these books: the knowledge of the elders,
the scriptures and tablets of our ancestors. This is our inheritance.
Learn as much as you can, work as hard you can. Lift your head, rise!
Be a true member of our proud community.''

The \key[Chaos]{Priests of Chaos} say: ``Life is Chaos: the weeds in
the plowed fields, the orchards gone to woods, the shore worn away by
the sea. Chaos is long patterns: the rivers unfurl, the clouds move as
they will but each with their own way.

The Elves make homes in the trees, but not by killing them and cutting
them into sharp-edged planks then watching those rot and weather. No,
they watch for the trees' patterns and shape them slowly and live
among them; the tree living, the Elf living.

Order is the hubris that mans' whims can be imposed on the world, and
dooms them—man, woman, and child—to a lifetime of wearying burden.
Chaos is not the burning of cities, but realizing the foolishness of
building such at all. Chaos is not lawlessness, but realizing that
men, like trees, have their ways, and to lay laws upon them without
acknowledging this, is to cut them down and bury them in plank-sided
boxes. Come with me. I know not where I'm going, but we will learn
along the way.'' \marginnote{The Chaos Priest's statement was taken

\section{Basic Rules}
\label{sec:basicrules}

Some key terms, first.

\key{Player}: The people sitting at the table, you, me, our friends.

\key{Player Character}: The people we’re playing. My character is
called Edrig and hails from Einaheim.

\key{Experience Points} (\key{XP}): Defeating opponents grants
experience points, and spending money nets you \emph{one experience
  point per gold piece spent}. Examples: donations to a temple,
erecting a statue, organizing a party, building a manor house, hiring
servants, and so on. With enough experience points characters gain new
levels.\marginnote[-6em]{As gold turns into experience, the pursuit of
  treasure is a central element of adventures. But note that sometimes
  the simple act of bringing the loot back to safety can be a problem
  if you are weakened and heavily loaded on your way back to town.}
Gold (and thus XP) can be passed to other characters as long as the
recipient's level is \emph{the same or lower}.

\key{Level}: As time passes, characters hit better, get better saving
throws and gain hit points. They \emph{gain a level}.

\key{Hit Points}: Hit points indicate your endurance, luck and will to
live.\marginnote{Hit points are a measure of how much of a beating a
  character can take.} As you \emph{gain} a level, roll as many dice
as you have levels and keep the result if it is is \emph{higher} than
your current hit point total. Fighters and dwarves use a d8, magic
users and thieves use a d4, everybody else uses a d6. Do not forget to
add your constitution bonus to every die rolled. If your constitution
bonus is negative, you'll still get at least 1 hit point for every
die. If you \emph{lose} a level, roll as many dice as you have levels
and keep the result if it is \emph{lower} than your current hit point
total.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Lucchesischer-Schaller.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

\key{Saving Throw}: When in mortal danger, you are sometimes granted a
saving throw in order to avoid negative effects or to reduce the
damage taken. Spell descriptions explicitly mention any saving throws
granted. Saving throws depend on your class and level. To make it,
roll a d20 and add your wisdom bonus. You must get the number
indicated, or higher.

\key{Circle}: As magic users and elves gain levels, they get access to
higher spell circles—more powerful spells:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{lcccccccccc}
Level  & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
Circle & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 &  5
\end{tabular}

\marginnote[-4em]{\key{Reaction Bonus}: This bonus is a bit smaller
  than the usual bonus because the \emph{reaction roll} uses 2d6
  instead of a d20. Use \emph{charisma} when speaking with mortals,
  use \emph{wisdom} when speaking to immortals.

  \medskip
  \begin{tabular}{cccl}
    Score & Bonus \\
    3      & -2 \\
    4–8   & -1 \\
    9–12  &    \\
    13–17 & +1 \\
    18     & +2 \\
  \end{tabular}

  \medskip
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    2d6	& They will… \\
    2 & attack you \\
    3 & rob you \\
    4 & threaten you \\
    5 & make demands \\
    6 & refuse to cooperate \\
    7 & be skeptical \\
    8 & be wavering \\
    9 & only take safe bets \\
    10 & cooperate \\
    11 & be friendly \\
    12 & be helpful \\
  \end{tabular}}

\medskip\key{Reaction Roll}: The referee will make a reaction roll for
almost all creatures characters talk to. Roll 2d6 and add the
\emph{reaction bonus} of the person doing the talking. If you don't
share a common \index{Languages!Reaction Roll}language, apply a -2
penalty. Typically a result of 5 or lower is considered a negative
outcome and a result of 9 and higher is considered a positive outcome.

\key{Morale Check}: Player characters must never check morale.
Everybody else must make a morale check when losing the first member
of their unit and another one when having lost half their unit's
members. The referee rolls 2d6 and compares it with the unit's morale:
if the roll came up higher, that unit breaks and flees. A unit must
make at most two morale checks per fight. Mercenaries hired by
characters must make morale checks when suffering losses.



\section{\index{Combat}Combat}
\label{sec:combat}

\key{Surprise}: Both sides roll a d6. Your side is surprised if you
roll a 1 or a 2. If you're surprised, you'll have to skip the first
round.

\key{Initiative}: At the beginning of every round, both sides roll a
d6.\marginnote{The worst that can happen is that opponents go twice in
  a row.} The higher number begins. On a tie, players begin.

\key{Round}: Every round, you can move and still do something before
or after your move.\marginnote{Anything may be \emph{attempted}, but
  chances of success and the time it takes will be determined at the
  table based on circumstances.} Typical \index{Action}actions: melee
or ranged attack, casting a spell, read a \index{Scroll}scroll, quaff
a \index{Potion}potion. \index{Getting Up}Getting up also counts as a
move. Dropping items you're holding, drawing a weapon or saying things
are free.

\key{To-Hit}: Roll a twenty-sided die (d20). Add the to-hit bonus
based on your level.\marginnote{The description of your class comes
  with a table with the to-hit bonus depending on your level.} Add the
armour class of your opponent. Add your strength bonus when making a
\index{Melee Attack}melee attack. Add your dexterity bonus when making
a \index{Ranged Attack}ranged attack. Add any magic bonuses, if you
have a magic weapon. If the sum is 20 or more,\marginnote{This is
  Delta's \href{http://www.oedgames.com/target20/}{Target 20} system.}
you hit.

\key[20, natural]{20}: If you roll a 20, you always hit and you do max
damage.

\key[30-sided die]{30}: Every player may use the thirty-sided die
(d30) in place of a d20 once per session. When rolling to hit, every
roll of twenty and above is a critical hit.

\key{Damage}: If you hit, roll damage using a d6.\marginnote{We don't
  use variable weapon damage. All weapons do 1d6 damage.} Add your
strength bonus when making a melee attack. There is no bonus for
ranged attacks.

\key{Shield}: When carrying a shield\marginnote{At low levels, shields
  are crucial! Unfortunately, thieves and magic users may not carry
  shields.} and hit by a melee weapon or a magical force such as a
lightning bolt or a fire ball, you may sacrifice the shield such that
it absorbs all damage and is destroyed.

\key{Space}: In a wide corridor (\unit[10]{ft}) three people can fight
side by side. The space required depends on the weapons used, however:
\marginnote{A typical setup would be four fighters in the front row
  with short swords or hand axes, four fighters in the second row with
  pole arms, and the rest in the back, shooting arrows and slinging
  stones.}

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Weapon Characteristic & Space Required & For \unit[10]{ft}\\
can be used in dense formations & \unit[2½]{ft} & 4 people \\
normal weapons & \unit[3]{ft} & 3 people \\
requires space to swing & \unit[5]{ft} & 2 people \\
requires a lot of space & \unit[10]{ft} & 1 person
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\key{Protection}: When you are attacked,\marginnote{Intelligent
  monsters can do the same thing and protect each other. Pets cannot
  place themselves in the line of an attack.} nearby friends can
protect you by placing themselves in the line of attack. The attacker
will roll to hit your friend instead of you. You can place yourself in
the line of at most \emph{one} extra attack per round.

\key{Targets}: When attacking, you can't pick individual
targets.\marginnote[-0.5em]{The referee will distribute hits amongst
  all the possible targets, but start every round with the same
  target. If your side lands two hits on three orcs this round, the
  first two orcs get hit. If you land another two hits next round,
  the same two orcs get hit.} It's carnage all around you! You can
pick the \emph{kind} of enemy: target an orc and not an ogre, for
example.

\key{Retreat}: When retreating, your opponents can follow you and
continue to attack unless somebody is covering your retreat. If you
need to move faster, you'll have to flee.

\key{Flee}: When running away, you'll have to survive one last round
of attacks. All your opponents in melee get one free attack with a +2
bonus.\marginnote[-4em]{Everybody in melee gets exactly \emph{one}
  extra attack against fleeing opponents. If you didn't use a melee
  weapon, you're not in melee and don't get to make an extra attack.}

\newpage

\section{Injury and Death}
\label{sec:injury}

Hit points are a measure of how much of a beating a character can
take. Once your hit points fall to \index{Hit Points!zero}zero, and
whenever you're hit thereafter, roll on the table of \emph{Death \&
  Dismemberment}.

\marginnote[1cm]{\key{Raise Dead} is a spell of the 5\th circle and
  requires a level~9 magic user or elf. It will not regrow missing
  limbs or broken bones. It simply restores you to life if you died
  due to hit point loss.

  \bigskip\noindent
  The Death \& Dismemberment table was adapted from a

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{cp{9.1cm}}
2d6 & Result \\

2 & \key[Death]{Instant Death}: Decapitated or other grievous wound \\

3 & \key[Wound]{Fatal Wound}: gutted, stabbed through lung, broken
back; you'll die in 1d6 rounds \\

4 & \key[Amputation]{Severed Limb}: roll a d4: 1 – sword arm, 2 –
shield arm, 3, 4 – leg; you'll die in 3d6 rounds unless you cauterize
the wound using fire or stop the bleeding using a tourniquet \\

5 & \key{Broken Bones}: roll a d4: 1 – sword arm, 2 – shield arm, 3
– leg, 4 – rib; healing takes 2d4+9 weeks \\

6 & \textbf{Painful Loss}: roll a d6: 1 – nose, 2 – eye, 3 – ear, 4
– finger, 5 – d6 teeth, 6 – mean cut and ugly scar \\

7, 8 & \key{Unconscious}: knocked out and helpless for 2d6 rounds
unless wearing a helmet; with a helmet, stunned for a round \\

9 & \textbf{Stunned}: knocked down and no attacks for a round unless
wearing a helmet; with a helmet, knocked down \\

10 & \key{Knocked Down}: opponents get +4 to hit \\

11 & \textbf{No effect}: you suffer no additional harm \\

12 & \key{Adrenalin Surge}: you get 1d4 hit points for every two
levels you have (round up); after the fight you'll collapse with zero
hit points and faint for 2d6 rounds
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\bigskip

\key{Conditions}: The \emph{Death \& Dismemberment} table imposes
various conditions:

\textbf{Arm Lost or Broken}: You can retrain your sword hand, no
problem. You'll need a hand to cast spells.\marginnote{If you lose
  both arms, you'll need to get yourself a new arm. A mechanical arm
  made by gnomes will do, if you'll trust them not to pull a prank on
  you.

  If you lose both legs, you'll need to find somebody
  to carry you or magical means of movement.}

\textbf{Leg Lost or Broken}: You can't walk. A lost leg can be
replaced with a wooden leg. You cannot run or sneak using a wooden
leg.

\textbf{Rib Broken}: No sudden moves with a broken rib or you'll
pierce your lung! No fighting. No running.

\key{Helpless}: you can be killed without requiring a roll to hit.

\key{Stunned}: you cannot move and you cannot attack, but opponents
must still roll to hit.

\key{Knocked Down}: opponents get +4 to hit you until you get up;
getting up prevents you from moving in the same round.

\textbf{Charm Person} turns \emph{one} humanoid creature into a loyal

\textbf{Detect Magic} makes all enchanted items, creatures and
locations within \emph{\unit[60]{ft}} shine with a pale blue light for
\emph{\unit[20]{min}}.\marginnote[-1em]{The pale blue light is visible
  to all.}

\textbf{Light} enchants one object within \emph{\unit[120]{ft}} for
\emph{\unit[1]{h} + \unit[10]{min/level}} so that it shines faint
light with a \emph{\unit[15]{ft}} radius.\marginnote[-2em]{If you target the
  eyes of a creature, it will go blind for as long as the spell lasts.
  Blind creatures are at -4 to hit. Targets are granted a saving throw
  vs.~spells.}

\textbf{Magic Missile} hits any visible target within
\emph{\unit[150]{ft}} and causes 1d6+1 damage.\marginnote{There is no
  saving throw!} At 5\th level, \emph{three} missiles can be shot at
the same time and they hit different targets. At 10\th level,
\emph{five} missiles can be shot.

\textbf{Read Magic} allows you to decipher magical runes for
\emph{\unit[10]{min}}. This is how to read spell books, scrolls and
magical inscriptions.

\textbf{Sleep} puts \emph{2d8 hit dice} of creatures within
\emph{\unit[240]{ft}} to sleep for \emph{4d4 $\times$ \unit[10]{min}}.
This is a magical slumber.\marginnote{There is no saving throw!} They
need to be slapped in order to wake them before the spell ends. No
creature may have more than 4+1~hit dice. Creatures with less hit dice
are affected first.

  save vs.~death or be swept away. If wearing metal armor, save
  vs.~death again or drown within a minute or two.
